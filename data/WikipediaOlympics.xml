      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7534">The '''Court of Arbitration for Sport''' ('''CAS'''; {{lang-fr|Tribunal Arbitral du Sport}} or ''TAS'') is an international arbitration body set up to settle disputes related to [[sport]]. Its headquarters are in [[Lausanne]] and its courts are located in [[New York]], [[Sydney]] and [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]].  Temporary courts are built in current [[Olympic host cities]].

==Jurisdiction and appeals== 
Generally speaking, a dispute may be submitted to the CAS only if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties which specifies recourse to the CAS. According to rule 61 of the Olympic Charter all disputes in connection with the Olympic Games can only be submitted to CAS.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic1&quot;&gt;[[International Olympic Committe]]: [http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf Olympic Charter]&lt;/ref&gt; 
All Olympic [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for at least some disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. McLaren, [http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1482&amp;context=sportslaw Twenty-Five Years of the Court of Arbitration for Sport: A Look in the Rear-View Mirror, 20 Marq. Sports L. Rev. 305] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
Through compliance with the 2009 [[World Anti-Doping Agency|World Anti-Doping Code]] all signatories, including all Olympic International Federations and [[National Olympic Committee]]s, have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for [[Doping in sport|anti-doping rule violations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[World Anti-Doping Agency]]: [http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/code_v2009_en.pdf 2009 World Anti-Doping Code]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Findlay and Marcus F. Mazzucco: [http://www.academia.edu/1190383/The_Supervisory_Role_of_the_Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport_in_Regulating_the_International_Sport_System The Supervisory Role of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Regulating the International Sport System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisions of CAS can be appealed to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Swiss Federal Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/d2wfiles/document/6110/5048/0/Media20Release20FC20Sion.pdf Media release 23 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals of CAS decisions are rarely successful, and generally limited to procedural matters (the sole exceptions are appeals on the grounds that &quot;the award is incompatible with public policy&quot;). {{As of|2012|3}} there has been seven successful appeals. Six of the upheld appeals were procedural, only once has the Swiss Federal Tribunal overruled a CAS decision based on the merits of the case. This was in the case of [[Matuzalém]], a Brazilian football player.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Levy: [http://www.probst-law.ch/bilder/The-International-Sports-Law-Journal-2012.pdf Swiss Federal Tribunal overrules CAS award in a landmark decision: FIFA vs Matuzalem]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With the intermixing of [[sports and politics]], the body was originally conceived by [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] to deal with disputes arising during the Olympics. It was established as part of the IOC in [[1984 in sports|1984]]. 

In [[1994 in sports|1994]], a case decided by the CAS was appealed to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], challenging CAS impartiality. The Swiss court ruled that the CAS was a true court of [[arbitration]] but drew attention to the numerous links between the CAS and the IOC.

In response, the CAS underwent reforms to make itself more independent of the IOC, both organizationally and financially. The biggest change resulting from this reform was the creation of an &quot;International Council of Arbitration for Sport&quot; (ICAS) to look after the running and financing of the CAS, thereby taking the place of the IOC. {{As of|2004}}, most recent cases that were considered by the CAS dealt with transfer disputes within professional [[association football]] or with [[use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]].

==Jurisprudence== 
In November 2009 CAS decided its first case on [[biological passport|athlete biological passports]], when it upheld the two-year suspension of skater [[Claudia Pechstein]]. In March 2011 the court suspended two Italian cyclists, [[Franco Pellizotti]] and [[Pietro Caucchioli]], for two years based on evidence from their blood profiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/sports/cycling/09cycling.html?_r=1 Court Upholds Cyclist’s Ban Based on Biological Passport] New York Times. Retrieved 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, in a case affecting the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the court declared that a part of the [[Olympic Charter]] violated the World Anti-doping Code. The Osaka rule prevented athletes suspended for at least six months for anti-doping rule violations from competing at the Olympic Games following the suspension's expiration. The court later re-affirmed this decision, when it struck down a long-standing by-law of the [[British Olympic Association]] preventing the selection of athletes sanctioned for doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/17853070 |title=London 2012: Dwain Chambers eligible after court ruling |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the IOC and BOA have responded by campaigning for adding a similar rule at the next update of the Code, which will be in effect by the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

The court is reluctant to overturn [[Referee|field of play decisions]], though it may do so in cases where there is clear evidence that the officials acted in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport:[http://www.tas-cas.org/d2wfiles/document/6083/5048/0/Award20273120_FINAL_.pdf CAS 2012/A/2731 ''BOC &amp; BTC &amp; Márcio W. Ferreira v/ WTF &amp; COM &amp; FMT &amp; Damian A.Villa Valadez'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The court ruled in 2006 that [[Gibraltar Football Association|Gibraltar]] had valid grounds for its application to join [[UEFA]], forcing the organisation to hand it provisional membership. At the next UEFA Congress, however, Gibraltar was overwhelmingly rejected in a vote, due to lobbying from [[Spain]], in defiance of the CAS ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gibraltar have failed in their attempt to become a member of Uefa.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6302889.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010 the [[Irish Football Association]] took its case to CAS after FIFA failed to prevent the [[Football Association of Ireland]] from selecting Northern-Irish-born players who had no blood link to the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8538702.stm IFA take case to CAS]&lt;/ref&gt; The CAS ruled in favour of the FAI and FIFA by confirming that they were correctly applying the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fumagalli|first=Luigi|title=Irish Football Association v/ Football Association of Ireland, Daniel Kearns and FIFA|url=http://www.tas-cas.org/d2wfiles/document/4385/5048/0/Award%202071.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">The '''World Olympians Association''' (WOA) is an association of olympic athletes (&quot;Olympians&quot;) from all over the world, to promote the dissemination of Olympic ideals and fair play, advance environmental protection, educate against doping and drug use, supply educational resources, work against violence and intolerance, support diversity and equality, contribute to sport-related charities, host special hospitality centres, involve Olympians in social support, display positive role models, advance sport management and promote a culture of which sport is an important part.

An Olympian is any athlete who has been accredited to participate at a Summer or Winter Olympic Games. Olympians are WOA members through their local National Olympians Associations. Globally, there are over 100,000 Olympians.

IOC President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] created the World Olympians Association following the Centennial Olympic Congress, Congress of Unity, held in [[Paris]] in 1994. Formally, the WOA was established during a meeting held in the Olympic Museum on 21 November 1995 by 25 founder members.

In November 2011, [[Joël Bouzou]], an Olympic medalist from [[France]], was elected President of the Association. Joël is the founder of Peace and Sport and the Secretary General of the International Modern Pentathlon Federation (UIPM).

In January 2012, [[Prince Albert II of Monaco]] was announced as Patron of the Association.  Both the Prince and his wife [[Charlene, Princess of Monaco|Princess Charlene of Monaco]] are former Olympians.

==Objectives==
*To encourage contact between Olympians, in support of Olympism and the Olympic Movement, as set forth in the Olympic Charter. 
*To educate Olympians to become good ambassadors of the Olympic Movement 
*To promote the establishment of National Olympians Associations. 
*To foster cooperation between National Olympians Associations, in furtherance of the objectives of the WOA 
*To support and represent the interests of Olympians and contribute to the enhancement of their quality of life.

The '''Intercalated Olympic Games''' were to be a series of ''International Olympic Games'' half-way between what we now call Games of the [[Olympiad]]. This proposed series of games, [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalated]] in the Olympic Games cycle, was to always be held in [[Athens]], and were to have equal status with the international games. However, the only such games were held in 1906.

==Origin==

The first Intercalated Games had been scheduled by the [[IOC]] in 1901 as part of a new schedule, where every four years, in between the internationally organised games, there would be intermediate games held in Athens. This was apparently a bit of a compromise: After the successful games of [[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens 1896]] the Greeks suggested they could organise the games every four years. Since they had the accommodations, and had proven to be able to hold well-organised games, they received quite a bit of support. However, [[Pierre de Coubertin]] did not like this at all, he had intended the first games to be in [[Paris]] in 1900 and had no intention of losing not only the première for Paris but the games as well. Thus the second games became the [[1900 Summer Olympics|Paris 1900]] games.

When these games turned out less than perfect and were overshadowed by the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]], the IOC supported the Greek idea by granting them a second series of quadrennial games, in between the first series. All of the games would be International Olympic Games; the difference was that only half of them would follow De Coubertin's idea of organising them in different countries to make the Olympic Movement more international, while the other half would follow the Greeks' idea of a permanent home with the Greek [[National Olympic Committee|NOC]] as experienced organisers. This was a departure of the ancient schedule, but it was expected that if the ancient Greek could keep a four year schedule, the modern Olympic Movement could keep a two year schedule. As 1902 was now too close, and Greece was experiencing internal difficulties, the 2nd Olympic Games in Athens were scheduled for 1906.

As the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] were overshadowed by the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]], and as a result met with a fate similar to that of Paris 1900, the [[Olympic Movement]] was not in good shape. It desperately needed to recapture the spirit of [[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens 1896]]. It also needed to do so quickly, as to all those who didn't participate in St. Louis, [[1908 Summer Olympics|Rome 1908]] meant an 8-year gap. By that time there would not be much goodwill left for the Games. And on top of that, [[Rome]] was planning an [[World's Fair|Exhibition]]. The Athens games being just around the corner must have seemed like a lifeline. De Coubertin still disliked the idea, and didn't do anything more than his function required him to. But the IOC as a whole gave the Greek NOC full support for the organisation.

==First Intercalated Games==
The [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 games]] were quite successful. Unlike the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] or [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] games, they were neither stretched out over months nor overshadowed by an international exhibition. Their crisp format was most likely instrumental in the continued existence of the games.

These Games also were the first games to have all athlete registration go through the NOCs. They were the first to have the Opening of the Games as a separate event; an event at which for the first time the athletes marched into the stadium in national teams, each following its national flag. They introduced the closing ceremony, and the raising of national flags for the victors, and several more less visible changes now accepted as traditional.

==Decline==
The [[Greece|Greeks]] were unable to keep the schedule for 1910. On the one hand problems in the [[Balkans]] made things difficult, but on the other, the modern Greeks found out the ancient Greeks were right: A two year interval was too short. Where there had been a gap of six years before Athens 1906 (because of the almost all-American nature of the 1904 St Louis games), a gap of two years after London 1908 did not leave people enough time to prepare.

With Athens 1910 a failure, the faith in Athens diminished, and as a result Athens 1914 got even less support. And then [[World War I]] started, and any further Intercalated Games had to wait until after the war. But after the war was over it had been more than a decade since Athens 1906, and the idea of Intercalated Games was given up entirely.

==Downgrading==
Since the 2nd International Olympic Games in Athens now had become an exception, the personal views of various IOC chairmen caused the IOC to retroactively downgrade the 1906 games, and the explanation for the games became that they had been a 10th anniversary celebration. As more stress was placed on the continuing sequence of four-year Olympiads, the games of 1906 did not fit in. Hence, today the IOC does not recognize Athens 1906 as Olympic Games, and does not regard any events occurring there, such as the setting of new records or the winning of medals, as official.

The success of Athens 1906, however, may have been what kept the Olympics alive. And as the next games are always built on the successes of the last, the innovations of Athens were used again in London, and eventually became Olympic tradition. In fact, the influence of the First Intercalated Games pervades the Olympics, with the holding of the Games concentrated in a small time period, at a small area, and with good organization.

==Winter sports==
Since there were no winter sports at the First Intercalated games, the idea has arisen that this was because the IOC had made such an explicit requirement. In reality, though the IOC had intended some winter sports to be Olympic, before London 1908 none of the games included any winter sports, and Athens 1906 was no exception.

It is worth noting, however, that one of the ideas of the Intercalated Games - namely that the games took place two years either side of Summer Olympics - has been revived for the [[Winter Olympic Games]] since [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]].

The '''World Anti-Doping Agency''' ('''WADA'''; {{lang-fr|Agence mondiale antidopage}}) is an independent foundation created through a collective initiative led by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). It was set up on November 10, 1999 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], as a result of what was called the &quot;Declaration of Lausanne&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Lausanne Declaration on Doping in Sport|author=Staff|newspaper=sportunterricht.de, |date=February 4, 1999 |url=http://www.sportunterricht.de/lksport/Declaration_e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against [[doping (sport)|drugs in sport]]. WADA is responsible for the '''World Anti-Doping Code''', adopted by more than 600 sports organizations, including international sports federations, national anti-doping organizations, the IOC, and the [[International Paralympic Committee]]. Its current President is former Australian finance minister [[John Fahey (politician)|John Fahey]], who in 2008 succeeded to [[Dick Pound]], a former IOC vice-president and outspoken opponent of drugs in sport. In 2001, WADA voted to move its headquarters to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], the following year.

Initially funded by the [[International Olympic Committee]], WADA now receives half of its budgetary requirements from them, with the other half coming from various [[government]]s throughout the [[world]]. Its governing bodies are also composed in equal parts by representatives from the sporting movement (including athletes) and governments of the world. The agency's key activities include scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code – the document harmonizing regulations regarding anti-doping in all sports and countries. It also produces an annual list of prohibited substances and methods that sportspersons are not allowed to take or use.

== World Anti-Doping Code ==
{{Doping in sport sidebar |expanded=Anti-doping bodies}}
In 2004, the World Anti-Doping Code was implemented by sports organizations prior to the [[Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], harmonizing the rules and regulations governing anti-doping across all sports and all countries for the first time. More than 600 sports organizations (international sports federations, national anti-doping organizations, International Olympic Committee, International Paralympic Committee, a number of professional leagues in various countries of the world, etc.) have adopted the Code to date. 

Following an extensive consultation period, revisions to the World Anti-Doping Code were unanimously adopted at the Third World Conference on Doping in Sport in November 2007 to incorporate the experience gained from the enforcement of the initial Code. These revisions, which include a number of measures strengthening the global fight against doping in sport, took effect on 1 January 2009.

== Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention ==

The Anti-Doping Convention of the [[Council of Europe]] in Strasbourg was opened for signature on 16 December 1989 as the first multilateral legal standard in this field. It has been signed by 48 states including the Council of Europe non-member states Australia, Belarus, Canada and Tunisia. The Convention is open for signature by other non-European states. It does not claim to create a universal model of anti-doping, but sets a certain number of common standards and regulations requiring Parties to adopt legislative, financial, technical, educational and other measures. In this sense the Convention strives for the same general aims as WADA, without being directly linked to it.

The main objective of the Convention is to promote the national and international harmonisation of the measures to be taken against doping. Furthermore the Convention describes the mission of the Monitoring Group set up in order to monitor its implementation and periodically re-examine the list of prohibited substances and methods which can be found in annex to the main text.

An additional protocol to the Convention entered into force on 1 April 2004 with the aim of ensuring the mutual recognition of anti-doping controls and of reinforcing the implementation of the Convention using a binding control system.

== UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport ==
{{main|International Convention against Doping in Sport}}
Given that many governments cannot be legally bound by a non-governmental document such as the World Anti-Doping Code, they are implementing it by individually ratifying the [[UNESCO]] [[International Convention against Doping in Sport]], the first global international treaty against doping in sport, which was unanimously adopted by 191 governments at the UNESCO General Conference in October 2005 and came into force in February 2007. As of June 2013, 174 states have ratified the Convention, setting a UNESCO record in terms of speed.

The UNESCO Convention is a practical and legally binding tool enabling governments to align domestic policy with the World Anti-Doping Code, thus harmonizing the rules governing anti-doping in sport. It formalizes governments' commitment to the fight against doping in sport, including by facilitating doping controls and supporting national testing programs; encouraging the establishment of &quot;best practice&quot; in the labelling, marketing, and distribution of products that might contain prohibited substances; withholding financial support from those who engage in or support doping; taking measures against manufacturing and trafficking; encouraging the establishment of codes of conduct for professions relating to sport and anti-doping; and funding education and research.

== Criticism ==
=== Statistical validity ===
Professor Donald A. Berry has argued that the closed systems used by anti-doping agencies do not allow statistical validation of the tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berry DA |title=The science of doping |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |pages=692–3 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18685682 |doi=10.1038/454692a |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was seconded by an accompanying editorial in the journal ''Nature'' (August 7, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=A level playing field? |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |page=667 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18685647 |doi=10.1038/454667a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7205/full/454667a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-doping community and scientists familiar with anti-doping work rejected these arguments. On October 30, 2008, Nature (Vol 455) published a Letter from WADA to the Editor countering Berry's article.

=== Paruresis ===
In spite of a growing awareness of, and catering for the condition [[paruresis]] by a number of other drug testing agencies, some of which deal with convicted prisoners and those on probation, the WADA urine sampling rules do not at present cater to sufferers of this condition. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

== ''Whereabouts'' controversy ==

The current anti-doping code revised the &quot;Whereabouts&quot; system in place since 2004, now requiring athletes to select one hour per day, seven days a week to be available for no-notice drugs tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/7892590.stm | work=BBC News | title=Athletes air issues over testing | date=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led to a legal challenge from '''Sporta''', the Belgian sports union, who argue that the system violates [[Article 8 ECHR|Article 8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc2&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/7844918.stm | work=BBC News | first=Matt | last=Slater | title=Legal threat to anti-doping code | date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FIFPro]] is also preparing a challenge based on data protection and employment law.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc2&quot;/&gt;

A significant number of sports organizations, governments, athletes, and other individuals and organizations have expressed support for the new Whereabouts requirements. The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/antidoping/news/newsid=49573.html IAAF opinion on &quot;new&quot; whereabouts requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UK Sport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukad.org.uk/news/uk_sport_statement_on_athlete_whereabouts/ UK Sport Statement on Whereabouts]&lt;/ref&gt; are two of the most vocal supporters of this rule. Tennis all-time great [[Roger Federer]] has also expressed approval for rigorous testing saying that &quot;the guy is cheating and they are smart, right?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/05/stories/2009080553100800.htm Hindu.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Both FIFA and UEFA have criticized the system citing privacy concerns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7961907.stm News.BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; as has the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/03/stories/2009080357830100.htm Hindu.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

WADA has also published a Q&amp;A explaining the rationale for the change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/International-Standards/IST/QA-on-Whereabouts/ WADA Q&amp;A on Whereabouts]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed in May 2011 that the [[National Football League]], which had previously resisted more stringent drug testing may allow WADA to conduct its drug tests instead of doing it in house.  This could lead the way to testing for HGH, which had previously been without testing in professional [[American football]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sportssupplementreviewer.com/2011/05/nfl-could-enlist-wada-testing/ WADA to test NFL]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[artistic gymnastics]], '''Alternate Olympics''' refers to two separate competitions held in 1980 and 1984. Because of the American-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] and the Soviet-led [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]], the alliances of countries that participated in each boycott organized their own alternative competitions. In 1980, these competitions were divided by sport, and included such events as the [[Olympic Boycott Games]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1984, while competitions for different sports still occurred in different countries and cities, they were all tied together under the aegis of the [[Friendship Games]].

== USGF International Invitational 1980 ==
In 1980, the gymnastics segment of the 'Alternate Olympics', entitled the 1980 USGF International Invitational, was held in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]]. Nations who sent athletes to this competition included Japan, China, the USA, Switzerland, West Germany, Italy, Norway, Korea, Canada, New Zealand and Israel.

== Friendship Games 1984 ==
{{main|Friendship Games}}

In 1984, the Soviet Bloc and most other Eastern European Communist nations held a [[Friendship Games]], also called &quot;Druzhba&quot;, with separate host cities hosting separate sporting events. The gymnastics segment of the Friendship Games was held in the town of in [[Olomouc]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]). The competition was referred to as 'ČSSR Spartakiade' or, simply, 'Olomouc' after the host city.

Most Eastern Bloc and Communist countries, including the Soviet Union, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, North Korea and Poland, as well as Great Britain and Mongolia, sent athletes to these games instead of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]]. [[Romania]] was the only country in the Eastern Bloc to defy the Olympic boycott and sent its athletes to Los Angeles, with some controversy. Great Britain sent gymnasts to ''both'' Olomouc and the Olympics.

Oloumouc was notable as the first, and to date, only, time that a gymnast had a 'perfect' competition, earning 10.00 scores on all events. [[Olga Mostepanova]] achieved this feat in the women's all-around, winning the gold medal with a 40.00. She also maintained a perfect score on [[balance beam]] throughout all of the rounds of competition at Olomouc, earning 10.00 marks every time she performed on the event in the team competition, all-around and event finals.

The '''Friendship Games''' or '''Friendship-84''' ({{lang-ru|Дружба-84}}, ''Druzhba-84'') was an international [[multi-sport event]] held between 2 July and 16 September 1984 in the [[Soviet Union]] and eight other [[socialist state]]s which [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]].

==Background==
[[File:Juan Antonio Samaranch DF-ST-01-00128.JPEG.jpg|thumb|left| [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] (''2000 photograph''), [[Presidents of the International Olympic Committee|President of the IOC]], held a conference with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries in May 1984, attempting to change their decision on boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]]. Instead, the socialist states used this meeting to discuss details of their own multi-sport event, the Friendship Games. Samaranch's only success was [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]'s confirmation that it would not join the boycott.]]

On 8 May 1984, less than three months before the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] were scheduled to begin, the [[Soviet Union]] announced its decision to boycott the Games, citing lack of security for Soviet athletes in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Soviet-pullout-rocks-Games&gt;{{cite news  |date=9 May 1984 |title=Soviet pullout rocks Games |newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eVwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l6UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1833,4342317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] news agency further accused the [[United States]] of trying to &quot;exploit the Games for its political purposes&quot;&lt;ref name=Alternate-Games-Would-Repudiate-Charter&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=Alternate Games Would Repudiate Charter |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-_EuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UM8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1287,7742871}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the &quot;arrogant, hegemonic course of the Washington administration in international relations is at odds with the noble ideals of the Olympic movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=Alternate-Games-Would-Repudiate-Charter /&gt;
In an article published by the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' several hours before the official announcement, [[Victor Louis (journalist)|Victor Louis]] – a Soviet journalist writing for the Western press, thought to be used by the Kremlin as an unofficial means of leaking information to the West&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lowitt |first1=Bruce |date=14 May 1984 |title= Afghanistan Joins Boycott (part 1)|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=-MMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6804,4042639 }} {{cite news|last1=Lowitt |first1=Bruce |date=14 May 1984 |title= Afghanistan Joins Boycott (part 2)|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=-MMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5131,4049411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=Bulgaria pulls out, Reagan intervenes|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=auYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7131,2161071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – first informed the world of the USSR's decision to boycott, adding that detailed plans for the &quot;Soviet bloc's alternative games&quot; had already been made. Louis claimed they would &quot;probably be announced at the last minute to throw the American organization into chaos&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes /&gt; The article named [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] as the possible host country.&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes /&gt; On 10 May, Bulgaria became the first Soviet ally to join the boycott,&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes /&gt; soon followed by [[East Germany]] (also 10 May),&lt;ref name=East-Germany-withdraws-from-Summer-Games&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=East Germany withdraws from Summer Games|newspaper=The [[Evening Independent]] |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=cAIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i1kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7026,2613126 |location=[[St. Petersburg, Florida]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mongolia]] and [[Vietnam]] (both 11 May).&lt;ref name=Vietnam-Mongolia-join-Games-bailout&gt;{{cite news|last1= |first1= |date=12 May 1984 |title=Vietnam, Mongolia join Games bailout|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bOYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7079,2953727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis wrote another article on 13 May, for the French ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'',&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; once again stating that the Soviet Union was contemplating counter-Olympic Games, possibly held in [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria. However, this time he noted that the idea was unlikely, as the Soviets feared that organizing such an event might prompt the [[International Olympic Committee]] to exclude the USSR.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; On the same day, Soviet sports commentator Vsevold Kuskuskin, during an interview for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television program ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with David Brinkley]]'', said the [[Eastern Bloc]] would definitely not organize such games.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; Also on 13 May, [[Laos]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] announced their decision to boycott the Los Angeles games.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt;&lt;ref name=Czechoslovakia-Laos-join-the-list&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joyce |first1=Dick |date=13 May 1984 |title=Czechoslovakia, Laos join the list|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-R8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=facEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1529,6975019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May, Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, called a press conference to discuss the boycott.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming&gt;{{cite news|last1= |first1= |date=15 May 1984|title=Soviets, slamming Olympics door, charge US plot |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0515/051549.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conference, Gramov assured &quot;Moscow would not support any alternative games staged to compete with the Olympics&quot;.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt; On the same day, [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] stated that, while Eastern Bloc officials had vetoed a counter-Olympics idea, the Bloc would instead &quot;sponsor sports events in various nations as a substitute for participation in the Los Angeles games&quot;,&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt; holding them at a different time than the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt;

[[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] became the ninth country to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics on 16 May, followed by Poland a day later.&lt;ref name=Hungary-joins&gt;{{cite news |date=16 May 1984 |title=Hungary joins Soviet boycott |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=sbAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5389,2026175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poland-10th&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnard |first1=William R. |date=17 May 1984 |title=Poland 10th to join Olympic boycott |newspaper=[[The Deseret News]]  |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=4g8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6350,599674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May, Olaf Brockmann of Austrian newspaper ''[[Die Presse]]'', citing Alexander Ushakov, head trainer of the Soviet decathlon team, said Eastern Bloc countries were hastily arranging a series of sports events.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing&gt;{{cite news |date=20 May 1984 |title=Soviet Bloc Discussing Own Games |newspaper=[[Ocala Star-Banner]]  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HR8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6793,2319906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brockmann named five competitions: two track and field athletics meets, one to be held in [[Prague]], Czechoslovakia, and the other in [[East Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]], East Germany; plus fencing, modern pentathlon and boxing events to be held in Poland.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing /&gt; Ushakov reportedly said the events would be held either before or after the Olympics, to avoid conflicts with the IOC, which would ban any form of counter-Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing /&gt;

[[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], [[Presidents of the International Olympic Committee|President of the IOC]], held a conference with Olympic Committees of eleven Eastern Bloc countries (eight of the boycotting states – Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, the Soviet Union and Vietnam – plus [[Cuba]], [[North Korea]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]])&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan&gt;{{cite news  |date=25 May 1984 |title=Communist nations plan own games |newspaper=Mohave Daily Miner |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SZUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s1YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1054,3766667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Prague, Czechoslovakia, starting on 21 May.&lt;ref name=Communist-leaders&gt;{{cite news |date=21 May 1984 |title=Communist leaders confer on Olympics |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XzAjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=66UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5073,6946151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaranch hoped to convince the boycotting states to change their position,&lt;ref name=Communist-leaders /&gt; but while Romania assured him it would attend the Los Angeles Olympics,&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; the remaining ten countries did not change their stance and even used the meeting to discuss &quot;their own summer games&quot;.&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; The official announcement was made by Antonin Himl, President of the Czech National Olympic Committee, who appeared on Prague television on 24 May.&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Himl said that, after the Olympic Games ended, various Eastern bloc countries would hold their own sport events in Olympic disciplines.&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Himl stated that the games' intention would be to &quot;give athletes who have conscientiously prepared for the past four years a possibility to sell their abilities&quot;.&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Thus, the Friendship Games idea was officially proclaimed.

Himl said the games would be held after 12 August (i.e. after the Summer Olympics), and that his country, Czechoslovakia, would host gymnastics, archery, women's handball, and women's track and field athletics.&lt;ref name=Boycott-nations&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 1984 |title= Boycott nations will stage own games |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-YNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3969,6224193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave assurances that the events would be open to all athletes, including those from non-boycotting nations.&lt;ref name=Boycott-nations /&gt;

Soon after the meeting, Cuba also announced its decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maxwell |first1=Evan |date=24 May 1984|title=Cuba Joins Olympic Boycott  |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/676722322.html?dids=676722322:676722322&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+24%2C+1984&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of June, [[North Korea]], [[South Yemen]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Angola]] had done the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 May 1984|title=Marxist South Yemen Becomes 12th Country to Drop Out of L.A.

In June, the Soviet Union asked [[Ted Turner]] and his [[Turner Broadcasting System]] to televise the events held in Hungary for American audiences.&lt;ref name=Ted-Turner1 /&gt; Turner eventually declined, but assured that his network would give spot coverage to the Games and treat it as any other sporting event.&lt;ref name=Ted-Turner2&gt;{{cite news |date=7 July 1984|title=Sports People; Turner Backs Off |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/07/sports/sports-people-turner-backs-off.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating nations==
[[File:1984 Friendship Games participants.png|thumb|right|Hosting nations shown in blue, other participants in green]]

Initial estimates placed the number of athletes participating in Soviet event venues at approximately 8000.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moscow-to-stage /&gt; Later, the number of expected participants was lowered to 2300, representing 49 countries.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=Good-times&gt;{{cite news|last1= |first1= |date=18 August 1984|title=Good times are in order at the Friendship Games|newspaper=[[The Deseret News]]  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5AzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6955,827200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Infosport&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Infosport (&quot;1984&quot; section) | url = http://www.infosport.ru/memoryPro/DocMemory.asp | accessdate = 29 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all the expected athletes showed up.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt; The exact number of athletes who took part in events held outside of the Soviet Union is unknown.

While Olympic-boycotting countries were represented by their strongest athletes, other states sent their reserve teams, consisting of athletes who failed to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;

Although the Games began on 2 July with table tennis events held in North Korea, the official opening ceremony was held on 18 August in Moscow, soon after the first events hosted by the Soviet Union started.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmemann |first1=Serge |date=19 August 1984|title=Friendship Games open with a Soviet challenge |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fpoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2829,2815005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp&gt;{{cite news |date=19 August 1984 |title=Friendship Games open with pomp|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a_MRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9-4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3838,1743115 | location=[[Spokane]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-hour ceremony held at the [[Luzhniki Stadium|Central Lenin Stadium]]&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; included &quot;girls in white leotards [spinning] red and white beachballs in unison, (...) dozens of children in traditional costumes of the Soviet republics&quot;,&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; a &quot;squadron of young performers&quot; which created &quot;a human weaving machine by ducking and turning to mesh their colored banners&quot;&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; and &quot;red-attired teenage girls with silver [[hula hoop]]s&quot;, which spelled the words 'USSR' and 'peace'.&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; The ceremony was described as being &quot;reminiscent of [[Olympic opening ceremony|Olympic galas]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt;

As in Olympic opening ceremonies,&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; a torch bearer (Soviet runner and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] gold medalist [[Viktor Markin]]) carried the flame into the stadium&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; and lit a giant bowl which had been built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt; The torch had been lit from an [[eternal flame]] for [[World War II]] victims located in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Teams marched onto the stadium behind flags, but unlike in the Olympics, they were not national teams but sporting organisations, such as [[Dynamo Sports Club|Dynamo]] or [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak]].&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Songs performed during the ceremony included a 1918 military march dedicated to the [[Red Army]], &quot;Stadium of My Dreams&quot;, written for the 1980 Olympics,&lt;ref name=who-is-coming&gt;{{cite news|last1= |first1= |date=17 August 1984|title=Games open but just who is coming? |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=afMRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9-4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6976,823056}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a specially composed song with the chorus &quot;To a sunny peace – yes, yes, yes / To a nuclear blast – no, no, no.&quot;&lt;ref name=peace-dominating&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eaton |first1=William |date= 19 August 1984|title=Peace dominating message at Friendship Games opening|newspaper=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hPEKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=708DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2742,3591862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Events were hosted by nine countries (Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, and the Soviet Union) between 2 July and 16 September 1984. With the exception of equestrian jumping, no events were held during the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (held between 28 July and 12 August).

The Games were contested in 22 Olympic disciplines (all except [[association football]] and [[synchronized swimming]]), and in non-Olympic [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], and [[sambo (martial art)|sambo wrestling]]. Additionally, the Friendship Games included non-Olympic women's shooting and rhythmic gymnastic events but not women's road race cycling, which became an Olympic event in 1984.

===Archery===
{{main|Archery at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union won five out of six possible medals.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0603-003, Uwe Hohn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Uwe Hohn]] won the gold medal in javelin throw]]

===Athletics===
{{main|Athletics at the Friendship Games}}
In an interview shortly before the events began, the Soviet team's coach [[Igor Ter-Ovanesyan]] said his athletes beat more than ten world records during the preparations for the competition.&lt;ref name=who-is-coming /&gt; While the Soviet athletes set no new records during the Games, they still dominated, winning more than a half of the gold medals. The only new world record was set by East German [[Irina Meszynski]] in women's discus throw, with 73.36 m.

Athletics was the only discipline which saw participation of recent [[1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medalists, with American sprinter [[Alice Brown (athlete)|Alice Brown]] taking part in women's 100-metre run, and West German [[Claudia Losch]] competing in shot put. However, neither won medals.&lt;ref name=Westerners-expected&gt;{{cite news|last1= |first1= |date=16 August 1984|title=Westerners expected at Communist Games|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]]  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dAYjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Us0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5774,4662666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987),  p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harvey |first1=Randy |date=25 August 1984|title=Tired Kratochvilova Beats U.S. Olympic Stars in 400|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unusual feat, [[Alberto Juantorena]] (Cuba) and [[Ryszard Ostrowski]] (Poland) both crossed the finish line at exactly the same moment in the men's 800-metre run. After the officials were unable to decide who came first – even after examining a [[photograph]] – both were declared winners.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt;

The annual Moscow marathon was declared to be a Friendship Games event in 1984. This caused a minor controversy, as the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] guards of the American [[embassy]], who usually took part in it, withdrew after learning it would be treated as a Friendship Games competition.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt;

===Basketball===
{{main|Basketball at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union won the men's final against Czechoslovakia 105:70, and Cuba came in third ahead of Poland. The USSR also finished first in the women's event, but since it was a [[round-robin tournament]], there were no semifinals or finals.

===Boxing===
{{main|Boxing at the Friendship Games}}
The host nation, Cuba, fully dominated the event, winning eleven out of twelve gold medals. East German [[Torsten Schmitz]] in the [[welterweight]] category was the only non-Cuban to win gold. [[Teófilo Stevenson]], three-time consecutive Olympic gold medalist who lost the chance to win his fourth gold when Cuba boycotted the Los Angeles Games, won the super heavyweight category.

Boxing was one of just three disciplines in which the Soviet Union did not win a gold medal, the others being modern pentathlon and table tennis.

===Canoeing===
{{main|Canoeing at the Friendship Games}}
Hosts East Germany and the Soviet Union won all twelve gold medals, six apiece.

===Cycling===
{{main|Cycling at the Friendship Games}}
The [[Schleizer Dreieck]] in [[Schleiz]], East Germany, usually used as a car or motorcycle race track, served as cycling venue for the individual road race. The event saw participation of top cyclists of the era, including numerous [[Peace Race]] veterans such as [[Uwe Ampler]] and [[Uwe Raab]].

[[File:Pirita Yachting Centre.jpeg|thumb|Pirita Yachting Centre in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] (now [[Estonia]]), where most of the sailing competitions were held. All of the events hosted by the Soviet Union took place at venues used during the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] four years earlier]]

===Diving===
{{main|Diving at the Friendship Games}}
Diving was yet another event dominated by East Germans and Soviets. Gold medalists included [[Aleksandr Portnov]] and [[Brita Baldus]].

===Equestrian===
{{main|Equestrian at the Friendship Games}}
Equestrian events were the only discipline contested at the same time as the 1984 Summer Olympics, as jumping events took place between 6 and 10 August. It was also the only discipline in which West German and Italian athletes won medals.

In individual dressage, [[Yuri Kovshov]] won both gold and silver, riding two different horses.

===Fencing===
{{main|Fencing at the Friendship Games}}
Soviet fencers won most of the men's events, while Hungary won both women's events, thanks to [[Gertrúd Stefanek]] and [[Edit Kovács]].

===Field hockey===
{{main|Field hockey at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union &quot;A&quot; team won the men's tournament, and while the Soviet Union &quot;B&quot; team came in third, fourth-place finishers [[Zimbabwe]] were awarded the bronze medal.

A team representing the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] also competed in the men's event, but lost all its matches, including a 0:27 loss to East Germany.

===Gymnastics===
{{main|Gymnastics at the Friendship Games}}
In artistic gymnastics, [[Olga Mostepanova]] achieved perfect &quot;10&quot; scores ten times: four in individual competitions, and six in team events.&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987),  p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; All fifteen medals in rhythmic gymnastics were won by just four athletes: Bulgarians [[Anelia Ralenkova]] and [[Diliana Gueorguieva]], and Soviets [[Galina Beloglazova]] and [[Dalia Kutkaitė]].

===Handball===
{{main|Handball at the Friendship Games}}
East Germany won the men's event, thanks to a 18:17 win over the Soviet Union, while Poland came in third. [[Péter Kovács (handballer)|Péter Kovács]] of Hungary was the top scorer with 26 goals. The USSR finished first in the women's tournament.

===Judo===
{{main|Judo at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union again won most of the gold medals. The event was also particularly successful for Poland, which won seven medals.

===Modern pentathlon===
{{main|Modern pentathlon at the Friendship Games}}
Hungarian [[László Fábián (pentathlete)|László Fábián]] won the individual competition, and Hungary also won the team event.

===Rowing===
{{main|Rowing at the Friendship Games}}
The USSR took 11 out of 14 gold  medals, while East Germany captured the remaining three.

===Sailing===
{{main|Sailing at the Friendship Games}}
Sailing took place on the [[Baltic Sea]], near [[Tallinn]], [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]], with the exception of 470 and Finn classes, which were contested on [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary. Soviets and East Germans won all of the gold medals. [[Canada]] and [[Finland]] won their only Friendship Games medals.

===Shooting===
{{main|Shooting at the Friendship Games}}
While most disciplines mimicked the Olympic Games in terms of events, women's shooting included non-Olympic competitions, namely the [[10 metre air pistol]] and [[50 metre rifle three positions]] events.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0619-033, Sylvia Gerasch.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvia Gerasch]] ''(1987 photograph)'', a 15-year-old, set the world record in women's 100 m breaststroke]]

===Swimming===
{{main|Swimming at the Friendship Games}}
Five new world records were set during the competition. [[Sergei Zabolotnov]]'s result of 1:58.41 in  men's 200 metre backstroke excited the crowd, as it was some one and a half seconds better than [[Rick Carey]]'s result during the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987),  p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen-year-old [[Sylvia Gerasch]] set the world record in women's 100 m breaststroke and was also part of the relay team that beat the 4 ×100 m medley record.&lt;ref name=Soviet-officials-shy /&gt;

===Table tennis===
{{main|Table tennis at the Friendship Games}}
Table tennis, a non-Olympic sport at that time, was the only event hosted by North Korea, which won four out of seven gold medals. Notably, the [[People's Republic of China]], which was at odds with most socialist states following the [[Sino-Soviet split]], took part in the event.

===Tennis===
{{main|Tennis at the Friendship Games}}
Soviet players dominated the singles category, and also won the men's doubles event. The Czechoslovakian women's double team was the only non-Soviet team to win gold.

===Volleyball===
{{main|Volleyball at the Friendship Games}}
Not surprisingly, the Soviet team finished first in the men's event, over Cuba and Poland. In women's tournament, Cuba won the final against the USSR.

===Water polo===
{{main|Water polo at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet team – composed mostly of the players who won gold during the 1980 Summer Olympics – finished first, while Hungary and Cuba took the second and third spots.

===Weightlifting===
{{main|Weightlifting at the Friendship Games}}
Dominated by Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, the event saw thirty world records broken,&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p186&gt;Chmielewski (1987),  p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; including two in the super heavyweight category, set by [[Anatoly Pisarenko]].

===Wrestling===
{{main|Wrestling at the Friendship Games}}
In addition to [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] events, non-Olympic [[sambo (martial art)|sambo]] wrestling events were also contested. Sambo was the only event hosted by Mongolia.

==Medal table==
The following table is based on statistics from the books ''Na olimpijskim szlaku 1984'' and ''Gwiazdy sportu '84'' and does not include sambo wrestling results.

==Comparisons to the Olympic Games==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0602-003, Marlies Göhr.jpg|thumb|[[Marlies Göhr]] won the women's 100 metre event with 10.95, slightly faster than [[Evelyn Ashford]]'s winning time of 10.97 at the Olympics]]
Media on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]] frequently compared the results of 1984 Summer Olympics and the Friendship Games.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;&lt;ref name=athletics-comparsion&gt;{{cite news |date=18 August 1984|title=Olympic vs. Friendship Games comparison|newspaper=[[The Deseret News]]  |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5AzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7182,828814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Afro-American&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lacy |first1=Sam |date=1 September 1984|title=For what it means: Olympic vs. Friendship|newspaper=The [[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wyImAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Xf4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5882,952037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olympics-Colliding-Myths&gt;{{cite news |last1=Henry III |first1=William A. |last2=Cazeneuve |first2=Brian |last3=Donnelly |first3=Sally B. |date=19 September 1988|title=Olympics: Colliding Myths After a Dozen Years |newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]  |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968447,00.html#ixzz0pDG1FkXk }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p151&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Over sixty Friendship Games results would have secured medals at the Olympic games.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt; East Bloc athletes outperformed Olympic winners in 20 of 41 track-and-field events and eleven of 29 swimming events.&lt;ref name=Olympics-Colliding-Myths /&gt; Had [[Li Yuwei]], who won the 1984 Olympic gold medal in [[50 metre running target]] shooting, obtained the same score in the Friendship Games, he would have only placed sixth.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p183&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in events such as weightlifting or wrestling, the Friendship Games had almost all of the top athletes of the time.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p151 /&gt;

However, some journalists noted that making such comparisons was unjustified, because of differing conditions and equipment. For example, [[Marlies Göhr]]'s result of 10.95 in women's 100 metre run was slightly better than [[Evelyn Ashford]]'s winning time of 10.97 at the 1984 Olympics, but when the two met head-to-head a week after the Friendship Games, Ashford was much faster than Göhr and set the new world record.&lt;ref name=Afro-American /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/moresports/columns/hollobaugh_jeff/57480.html |title=Szabo is in the money (&quot;No. 94&quot; section) |last1=Hollobaugh |first1=Jeff |date=14 September 1998 |work=[[ESPN]] |publisher= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Eastern Bloc results in track cycling were better than Olympic results, but Friendship Games cyclists competed on an indoor wooden track, while the Olympic events took place on an outdoor concrete track.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt; &quot;It is like saying [[Carl Lewis]] was faster than [[Jesse Owens]], [[Muhammad Ali]] would have beaten [[Joe Louis]] or [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] would have outrun [[Man o' War]]&quot;, [[Sam Lacy]] of ''the [[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]]'' concluded.&lt;ref name=Afro-American /&gt;

The comparisons also had political significance. While Friendship Games organizers repeatedly assured the press that their event was not an &quot;alternative Olympics&quot;,&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed /&gt;&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;&lt;ref name=Russians-host&gt;{{cite news |date=12 August 1984|title=Russians Host Their Own '84 Games |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8MYiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OmkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6606,984761}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably to avoid punitive IOC measures,&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed /&gt;&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt; Soviet state-run media often alluded to such comparisons.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt; The TASS agency declared that the Eastern Bloc's games were a &quot;major event in the Olympic year&quot;,&lt;ref name=Moscow-to-stage&gt;{{cite news |date=10 August 1984 |title=Moscow to stage games |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3570,4959807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Sovietsky Sport newspaper described the Games as the &quot;main event of the Olympic [[wikt:quadrennium|quadrennium]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt; Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, said that the &quot;socialist nations remain faithful to the task of strengthening the unity of the Olympics movement&quot;,&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt; while describing the Los Angeles Games as full of &quot;chauvinism and mass psychosis&quot;.&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt;

When asked about the Friendship Games, Monique Berlioux, then director of the IOC, said she had &quot;no reaction whatsoever&quot; to the competition.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 2006, the [[Law and Justice]] party in Poland proposed granting Friendship Games medalists sports retirement benefits similar to those given to Olympic medalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pis.org.pl/unit.php?o=parlament&amp;p=docs&amp;id=2&amp;iddoc=33 |title=Projekt ustawy o zmianie ustawy o sporcie kwalifikowanym | language= {{pl icon}} |author= |date= |work=[[Law and Justice]] party official website |publisher= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was never voted upon.

[[File:Siege cio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The seat of the IOC in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, March 2004]]

The '''International Olympic Committee''' ('''IOC''') (French: ''Comité international olympique'', ''CIO'') is a Swiss non-profit, non-governmental organization based in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, created by [[Pierre, Baron de Coubertin]], on 23 June 1894 with [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Demetrios Vikelas]] as its first president. Today its membership consists of 100 active members, 33 honorary members and 1 honour member.

The IOC organizes the modern [[Olympic Games]] and [[Youth Olympic Games]], held in Summer and Winter, every four years. The first [[Summer Olympics]] organized by the International Olympic Committee were held in [[Athens]], Greece, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]]; the first [[Winter Olympics]] were in [[Chamonix]], France, in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. Until 1992, both Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same year. After that year, however, the IOC shifted the Winter Olympics to the even years between Summer Games, to help space the planning of the two events two years apart from one another, and improve the financial balance of the IOC, which receives greater income on Olympic years. The first Summer Youth Olympics were in [[Singapore]] in [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|2010]] and the first Winter Youth Olympics were held in [[Innsbruck]] in [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|2012]].

==Organization==

===The IOC Session===
The [[IOC Session]] is the general meeting of the members of the IOC, held once a year in which each member has one vote. It is the IOC’s supreme organ and its decisions are final.

Extraordinary Sessions may be convened by the President or upon the written request of at least one third of the members.

Among others, the powers of the Session are:
* To adopt or amend the Olympic Charter.
* To elect the members of the IOC, the Honorary President and the honorary members.
* To elect the President, the Vice-Presidents and all other members of the IOC Executive Board.
* To elect the host city of the Olympic Games.

===The IOC Executive Board===
The IOC Executive Board consists of the President, four Vice-Presidents and ten other members. All members of the IOC Executive Board are elected by the Session, in a secret ballot, by a majority of the votes cast. The IOC Executive Board assumes the general overall responsibility for the administration of the IOC and the management of its affairs.

The IOC Session elects, by secret ballot, the IOC President from among its members for a term of eight years renewable once for a term of four years. The current IOC President, Jacques Rogge, was re-elected for a second term that consists of four years on 9 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IOC re-elects President Jacques Rogge |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Media/?articleNewsGroup=&amp;articleId=73403 |publisher=Olympic.org |date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In addition to the Olympic medals for competitors, the IOC awards a number of other honours:
* the IOC President's Trophy is the highest sports award given to athletes who have excelled in their sport and had an extraordinary career and created a lasting impact on their sport.
* the [[Pierre de Coubertin medal]] is awarded to athletes who demonstrate a special spirit of sportsmanship in Olympic events
* the [[Olympic Cup]] is awarded to institutions or associations with a record of merit and integrity in actively developing the Olympic Movement

==IOC members==
{{Further|List of members of the International Olympic Committee}}

[[File:Albert Meyer 4 Olympia 1896.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first IOC, at the 1896 Athens Games]]

For most of its existence, the IOC was controlled by members who were selected by other members. Countries that had hosted the Games were allowed two members. When named, they became not representatives of their respective countries to the IOC, but rather the opposite, IOC members in their respective countries.

For a long time, members of royalty have been members of co-option, such as [[Prince Albert II of Monaco]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/hsh-the-sovereign-prince-albert-ii HSH the Sovereign Prince ALBERT II]&lt;/ref&gt; as have former athletes. In addition King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]] has served as a member since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/hm-king-willem-alexander-of-the-netherlands HM King Willem-Alexander of the NETHERLANDS]&lt;/ref&gt; These last 10 years, the composition has evolved, in order to get a better representation of the sports world. Members seats have been allocated specifically to athletes, International Federations leaders and National Olympic Committees leaders. There are currently 100 members of the IOC, 33 honorary members, and 1 honor member.

===Membership===
The total number of IOC members may not exceed 115. Each member of the IOC is elected for a term of eight years and may be re-elected for one or several further terms. # A majority of members whose memberships are not linked to any specific function or office; their total number may not exceed 70; there may be no more than one such member national of any given country; # Active athletes, the total number of whom may not exceed 15, elected for eight years by their peers during the Olympic Games; # Presidents or persons holding an executive or senior leadership position within IFs, associations of IFs or other organizations recognized by the IOC, the total number of whom may not exceed 15; # Presidents or persons holding an executive or senior leadership position within NOCs, or world or continental associations of NOCs, the total number of whom may not exceed 15; there may be no more than one such member national of any given country within the IOC.

===Cessation of membership===
The membership of IOC members ceases in the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;Source: Olympic Charter, in force as from 1 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Resignation: any IOC member may cease their membership at any time by delivering his written resignation to the President.
# Non re-election: any IOC member ceases to be a member without further formality if they are not re-elected.
# Age limit: any IOC member ceases to be a member at the end of the calendar year during which they reach the age of 80.
# Failure to attend Sessions or take active part in IOC work for two consecutive years.
# Transfer of domicile or of main center of interests to a country other than the country which was theirs at the time of their election.
# Members elected as active athletes cease to be a member upon ceasing to be a member of the IOC Athletes’ Commission.
# Presidents and individuals holding an executive or senior leadership position within NOCs, world or continental associations of NOCs, IFs or associations of IFs or other organizations recognized by the IOC cease to be a member upon ceasing to exercise the function they were exercising at the time of their election.
# Expulsion: an IOC member may be expelled by decision of the Session if such member has betrayed their oath or if the Session considers that such member has neglected or knowingly jeopardized the interests of the IOC or acted in a way which is unworthy of the IOC.

===International federations recognised by IOC===

In 2012, the [[Indian Olympic Association]] was banned by the IOC due to various infractions, including government interference and bad governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCABRE8B30MY20121204?sp=true IOC bans Indian Olympic Association, elections void | Sports | Reuters].

==Olympic marketing==
In the early 1980s, the Olympics were highly dependent on revenues from a single source — its contracts with US television companies for the broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Upon his election as President of the IOC in 1980, [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] recognized this vulnerability and in consultation with Horst Dassler, a leading member of the Adidas family, the decision to launch a global marketing program for the IOC was made. Samaranch appointed Canadian IOC member Richard Pound to lead the initiative as Chairman of the &quot;New Sources of Finance Commission&quot;. In 1982 the IOC drafted ISL Marketing a Swiss sports marketing company,to develop a global marketing programme for the Olympic Movement. ISL successfully developed the programme but was replaced by Meridian Management, a company partly owned by the IOC in the early 1990s. In 2002 the IOC terminated the relationship with Meridian and took its marketing progarmme in-house under the Direction of Timo Lumme, the IOC's Managing Director of IOC Television and Marketing Services  .&lt;ref name=Supremo&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/olympics/news/2008-08/06/content_16143673.htm | title = IOC Marketing Supremo: Smile, Beijing | date = 6 August 2008 | accessdate =23 February 2011 | publisher=china.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, one of the staff members at ISL Marketing, [[Michael Payne (executive)|Michael Payne]],moved to the IOC and  became the organization's first marketing director. However ISL and subsequently Meridian, continued in the established role as the IOC's sales and marketing agents until 2002 &lt;ref name=Supremo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/Archive/SBJ-In-Depth/2005/07/How-The-IOC-Took-On-Nike-In-Atlanta.aspx | title = How the IOC took on Nike in Atlanta | date = 11 July 2005 | accessdate=23 February 2011 | publisher=[[Sports Business Journal]] | work=Sports Business Journal Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 17 years with the IOC,&lt;ref name=Supremo/&gt; in collaboration with ISL Marketing and subsequently Meridian Management, Payne made major contributions to the creation a multi-billion dollar sponsorship marketing program for the organization which, along with improvements in TV marketing and improved financial management helped to restore the IOC's financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sportinglife.com/others/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=others/05/02/14/manual_103457.html | title = London Bid 'Has Improved' | publisher=[[Sporting Life (magazine)|sportinglife.com]] | accessdate =23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0214/olympics.html | publisher=[[RTÉ Sport]] | date = 14 February 2005 | accessdate =23 February 2011 | title = Boost for London's Olympic Bid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Payne – London 2012 to tap fountain of youth | url = http://www.sportbusiness.com/print-edition/payne-london-2012-tap-fountain-youth | date = 22 October 2008 | accessdate =23 February 2011 | publisher=Sportbusiness.com | first = Struan | last = Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue===
The Olympic Movement generates revenue through five major programs. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) manages broadcast partnerships and the The Olympic Partner (TOP) worldwide sponsorship program. The Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) manage domestic sponsorship, ticketing and licensing programs within the host country under the direction of the IOC. The Olympic Movement generated a total of more than US$4&amp;nbsp;billion, €2.5 billion in revenue during the Olympic [[quadrennium]] from 2001 to 2004.

===Revenue distribution===
The IOC distributes some of Olympic marketing revenue to organizations throughout the Olympic Movement to support the staging of the Olympic Games and to promote the worldwide development of sport. The IOC retains approximately 10% of Olympic marketing revenue for the operational and administrative costs of governing the Olympic Movement.&lt;ref&gt;IOC: [http://www.olympic.org/ioc-financing-revenue-sources-distribution?tab=distribution Revenue Sources and Distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Organizing Committees of the Olympic Games (OCOGs)===
The IOC provides The Olympic Partner (TOP) program contributions and Olympic broadcast revenue to the OCOGs to support the staging of the Olympic Games and Olympic Winter Games:
* TOP Program Revenue to OCOGs; the two OCOGs of each Olympic quadrennium generally share approximately 50% of TOP program revenue and value-in-kind contributions, with approximately 30% provided to the summer OCOG and 20% provided to the winter OCOG.
* Broadcast Revenue to OCOGs; the IOC contributes 49% of the Olympic broadcast revenue for each Games to the OCOG. During the 2001–2004 Olympic quadrennium, the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee]] received US$443&amp;nbsp;million, €395 million in broadcast revenue from the IOC, and the Athens 2004 Organizing Committee received US$732&amp;nbsp;million, €690 million.
* Domestic Program Revenue to OCOGs; the OCOGs generate substantial revenue from the domestic marketing programs that they manage within the host country, including domestic sponsorship, ticketing and licensing.

===National Olympic Committees (NOCs)===
{{further|National Olympic Committee}}
The NOCs receive financial support for the training and development of Olympic teams, Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls. The IOC distributes TOP program revenue to each of the NOCs throughout the world. The IOC also contributes Olympic broadcast revenue to Olympic Solidarity, an IOC organization that provides financial support to NOCs with the greatest need.

The continued success of the TOP program and Olympic broadcast agreements has enabled the IOC to provide increased support for the NOCs with each Olympic quadrennium. The IOC provided approximately US$318.5&amp;nbsp;million to NOCs for the 2001–2004 quadrennium.

===International Olympic Sports Federations (IFs)===
The IOC is now the largest single revenue source for the majority of IFs, with its contributions of Olympic broadcast revenue that assist the IFs in the development of their respective sports worldwide. The IOC provides financial support from Olympic broadcast revenue to the 28 IFs of Olympic summer sports and the seven IFs of Olympic winter sports after the completion of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Winter Games, respectively.

The continually increasing value of Olympic broadcast partnership has enabled the IOC to deliver substantially increased financial support to the IFs with each successive Games. The seven winter sports IFs shared US$85.8&amp;nbsp;million, €75 million in Salt Lake 2002 broadcast revenue. The contribution to the 28 summer sports IFs from Athens 2004 broadcast revenue has not yet been determined, but the contribution is expected to mark a significant increase over the US$190&amp;nbsp;million, €150 million that the IOC provided to the summer IFs following Sydney 2000.

===Other organizations===
The IOC contributes Olympic marketing revenue to the programs of various recognized international sports organizations, including the [[International Paralympic Committee]], and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).

==Bidding to host the games==
{{main|Bids for Olympic Games}}
Countries wishing to host the Summer Olympic Games or the Winter Olympic Games compete aggressively to have their bid accepted by the IOC. The IOC members, representing most of the member countries, vote to decide where the Games will take place. Members from countries which have cities bidding to host the games are excluded from the voting process, up until the point where their city drops out of the contest. 

In recent years, the contest for the right to host the games has grown increasingly fierce and controversial. Allegations were leveled after the 1996 Olympics that Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) organizers bribed members of the IOC to obtain the Olympic Games. However, ACOG documents were destroyed prior to a formal inquiry and the allegations remain unproven. In his defense, ACOG Chairman Billy Payne said &quot;Atlanta's bidding effort included excessive actions, even thought processes, that today seem inappropriate but, at the time, reflected the prevailing practices in the selection process and an extremely competitive environment&quot;. 

In 2002, [[Salt Lake City]] was involved in a [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bribery scandal]] but earlier stories, reported by British journalists [[Vyv Simson]] and [[Andrew Jennings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1992 |title=The Lord of The Rings. Power, Money and Drugs in the Modern Olympics |publisher=Shuster &amp; Shuster |isbn=0-671-71122-9 |author=Simson &amp; Jennings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption in the IOC has been documented by numerous investigations. After the Salt Lake City scandal in which a number of IOC members were expelled following an extensive investigation, efforts were made to clamp down on abuses of the bid city process. More stringent rules were introduced and an advisory board of recently retired former athletes was set up. Critics of the organization believe more fundamental reform is required, for instance replacing the self-perpetuating system of delegate selection with a more democratic process.

Even legal attempts to sway the IOC to accept a city's bid can spark controversy, such as Beijing's [[2008 Summer Olympics bids|successful bid]] to host the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Several human rights organizations spoke out against the poor human rights condition of China, in conflict with the Olympic Charter of the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf &quot;Olympic Charter, in force as from 7 July 2007&quot;, International Olympic Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2007 interview on the Beijing 2008 website, IOC President Jacques Rogge said, the IOC &quot;definitely would love to see the continents that have not yet organized the Games like Africa or Latin America do that in the future. I cannot tell you exactly when, but I will see it in my life... We believe in the near future we can determine the host country under this rotating system. As of now, we haven't set a timetable for starting this system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamesbids1&quot;&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1186417801 – Olympic Bid News and Information Website]. Gamesbids.com. Retrieved on 8 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogge also said that he would like the IOC to give chance for the games to be held in [[Third World]] nations like [[Haiti]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Cameroon]] within 2020 and beyond.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamesbids1&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6780">[[File:Cesar Cielo at 2009 US World Trials.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Brazilian swimmer [[César Cielo]] wearing the Arena X-Glide swimsuit]]
'''Arena X-Glide''' is a [[swimsuit]] made of pure [[polyurethane]] that causes a swimmer to slide through water faster when swimming. One notable example of the efficacy of this suit design is that of [[Paul Biedermann]] of [[Germany]] who wore the suit in the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships|2009 World Championships]], breaking two world records.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/07/29/2013052.aspx|title=The science behind the swimsuit war|author=Alan Boyle|date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design of the suit covers basically the whole [[torso]] and the [[human leg|legs]], thereby exposing less skin to the water.  This significantly reduces the drag a swimmer experiences as he or she moves through the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/beijing/blog/fourth_place_medal/post/Down-goes-Michael-Phelps-beat-in-200m-free-fir?urn=oly,179248|title=Down goes Michael: Phelps beat in 200m free, first loss since '05|author=Chris Chase|publisher=Yahoo|date=July 28, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
According to Rick Sharp, an exercise physiologist at Iowa State University, &quot;The Speedo team came up with a design that put panels of polyurethane over parts of the body that produce the highest drag. Another part is the suit design: You don't want a suit that traps water as it flows around the swimmer. Yet another innovation is to use material that squeezes and slims down swimmers &quot;so the skin doesn't wobble around as they go through the water.&quot;  Pieces of fabric were put through wind-tunnel tests to check for drag. Programmers used computational fluid dynamics to model the suits' aerodynamic qualities, as if they were trying to figure out how a brand-new jet will fly. Then, swimmers put the designs to real-world tests in tanks and pools.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot; /&gt;

Following the incredible results the new Speedo LZR Racer swimsuit produced in the Beijing Olympics (Twenty-three world records were broken by the swimmers who wore LZR Racer suits, compared with only two that were broken by the swimmers who didn't. Speedo said 89 percent of all the medals in swimming, including 94 percent of the gold medals were won by LZR Racer swimmers),&lt;ref name=&quot;speedo&quot;&gt;[http://www.speedo80.com/lzr-racer/results/2008/8/18/phelps-secures-his-place-in-the-history-books/  Speedo 80 LZR News - August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Italian swimsuit makers Arena and [[Jaked]] responded by both developing suits that one-upped the Speedo by using pure polyurethane.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot; /&gt;

==Controversy==
There was a great deal of controversy in the swimming world surrounding polyurethane swimsuits, and strict rules banning these types of swimsuits in professional swimming were put into place.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot; /&gt; After Biedermann's wins in the 2009 World Championships, [[Michael Phelps]]' trainer (until then, Phelps had held the world record for the 200m freestyle since 2007) suggested that Phelps boycott international swimming competitions until the suit is banned.  Biedermann's breaking of both Ian Thorpe's 400m world record as well as Phelps's 200m record have been largely attributed to the superiority in the design of his swimsuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot; /&gt; Michael Phelps speculated that the new rules banning polyurethane will level the playing field once more, stating:
{{cquote|I will say that next year swimming will be swimming again. You're going to have to do all the work and there's not going to be a suit that does it for you.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot; /&gt;}} 
Phelps was the target of similar controversy before the Beijing Olympics for wearing a then-revolutionary swim-suit technology (the Speedo [[LZR Racer]]), created by his current sponsor, [[Speedo]], that was also reported to make the swimmer faster.  The LZR Racer went on to be offered to all swimmers competing in the Beijing Olympics.

==FINA rule changes==
Following the December 2008 [[European Short Course Swimming Championships 2008|European Short Course Championship]]s in [[Croatia]], where 17 world records fell, it was felt there was a need to modify the rules surrounding swimsuits. The combined effects of the LZR both compressing the body and trapping air for buoyancy led to many competitors who used the LZR wearing two or more suits for an increased effect. This led to some claiming that the LZR was in effect &quot;technological doping.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7944084.stm|title=Fina cracks down on hi-tech suits|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2009-03-14|accessdate=2009-03-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090317035422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7944084.stm| archivedate= 17 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At their meeting in [[Dubai]] on March 2009, FINA stipulated that swimsuits should not cover the neck, must not extend past the shoulders and ankles, and also limit the suits' thickness and buoyancy. In a statement FINA stated that:&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2&quot;/&gt;

{{cquote|Fina wishes to recall the main and core principle that swimming is a sport essentially based on the physical performance of the athlete.}}

The LZR Racer and all other Speedo Fast Skin Competition Suits were approved.  However other suits like the BlueSeventy Nero Comp were banned first and afterwards released, too.

In an abrupt reversal of opinion, the FINA Congress voted almost unanimously to revert its previous policy and ban all body-length swimsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reachforthewall.com/2009/07/24/suit-story/?hpid=artslot FINA Opts to Ban All High-Tech Swimsuits], ''reachforthewall.com'', July 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was taken in Rome on July 24, 2009, during the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships]].  The new policy states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area [[jammers|from the waist to the knee]], and women's counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.  They also ruled that the fabric used must be a textile (i.e. woven rather than a foil).  The new regulations took effect in January 2010.

USA Swimming, the United States governing body, made the date where all these suits will be illegal October 1, 2009.  

FINA has already released an outline of the legal suits to wear.  Among the suits on this list there is the Nike Swift, the Speedo FS PRO, and the Speedo LZR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9839">[[File:Nadia Comaneci 1977.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nadia Comăneci]] was the first woman to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics.]]
In [[gymnastics]], the maximum possible score was a '''perfect 10''' until the rules were changed in 2006 by the [[International Gymnastics Federation]] (FIG).&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news |title=A 10-shun Deficit |author=Diane Pucin |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=August 6, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/06/sports/sp-olyperfect6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Romanian [[Nadia Comăneci]] became the most famous gymnast in the world when she became the first woman to score a perfect 10 at the Olympic Games. Other gymnasts who accomplished this feat at the Olympics included [[Mary Lou Retton]] in 1984 and [[Daniela Silivaș]] in 1988. Currently, there are different top scores for various events based upon difficulty ratings and no consistent perfect score.

==Impetus for change==
The [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|scoring system]] came under review as a result of two incidents during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;sid=afyDFiqcZDig&amp;refer=australia |title=Olympic Gymnasts Won't Chase Perfect 10 as New Scoring Debuts |author=Dan Baynes |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|bloomberg.com]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the men's individual all-around competition, [[South Korea]]n [[Yang Tae-Young]] was awarded the bronze medal, rather than the gold, because of a scoring error, which the FIG decided to let stand. (However, both commentator [[Tim Daggett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=3876 |title=Olympic Gold All Around Gymnast Paul Hamm: Only Human |author=Mark Da Cunha |publisher=''Capitalism Magazine'' |date=August 19, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Miles Avery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/athens/gymnastics/2004-08-23-coach-comments_x.htm |title=Hamm's coach sounds off on double-gold talk |author=Jill Lieber |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=August 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; gold medalist [[Paul Hamm]]'s coach, later reviewed tapes of Yang's performance and stated they found a second scoring error, in which he was not docked 0.2 points for making four holds instead of the maximum allowed three, which would have more than offset the first error.)  The second controversy centered on [[Russia]]n [[Alexei Nemov]] in the men's [[horizontal bar]] final. The crowd so raucously voiced its displeasure with Nemov's score (perceived as too low) that the final was stopped for 10-15 minutes. Finally, the judges raised his score (though not enough for a medal). When this did not satisfy the spectators, Nemov himself had to plead with the crowd to allow the competition to continue.

==Criticism of the new system==
The new scoring system is open-ended, rewarding competitors for incorporating more difficult elements.

The change has its share of critics. &quot;It's crazy, terrible, the stupidest thing that ever happened to the sport of gymnastics,&quot; complained noted coach [[Béla Károlyi]].&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2197336/pagenum/all/#p2 |title=Down With the Perfect 10! |author=Jordan Ellenberg |publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' |date=August 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It's hard to understand. I don't even understand it,&quot;&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; remarked gymnast [[Mary Lou Retton]]. [[Romania]]n gymnast [[Nadia Comăneci]] commented, &quot;It's so hard to define sports like ours and we had something unique. The 10, it was ours first and now you give it away.&quot;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

The '''Cotswold Olimpick Games''' is an annual public celebration of games and sports now held on the Friday after [[Spring Bank Holiday]] near [[Chipping Campden]], in the [[Cotswolds]] of England. The Games probably began in 1612, and have continued on and off to the present day. They were started by a local lawyer, [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]], with the approval of [[James I of England|King James]]. Dover's motivation in organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm, but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together; the Games were attended by all classes of society, including royalty on one occasion.

Events included horse-racing, [[coursing]] with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and [[Club (weapon)|cudgel]]s, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes, and abundant food was supplied for everyone who attended. A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what is now known as Dover's Hill, complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events.

The Games took place on the Thursday and Friday of the week of [[Whitsun]], normally between mid-May and mid-June. Many 17th-century [[Puritan]]s disapproved of such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as Whitsun. By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642, bringing the Games to an end.

Revived after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660, the Games gradually degenerated into a drunk and disorderly country festival according to their critics. The Games ended again in 1852, when the [[common land]] on which they had been staged was partitioned between local landowners and farmers and subsequently [[Enclosure|enclosed]]. Since 1966 the Games have been held each year on the Friday after [[Spring Bank Holiday]]. Events have included the [[tug of war]], [[gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]], [[shin-kicking]], [[dwile flonking]], motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, and [[morris dancing]]. The [[British Olympic Association]] has recognised the Cotswold Olimpick Games as &quot;the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings&quot;.&lt;ref name=BOA/&gt;

==Origins==
The first Olimpick Games were probably held in 1612, organised by lawyer [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]], although different sources give dates from 1601 until 1612. Little is known about Dover. He was probably born between 1575 and 1582 in [[Norfolk]], one of four children born to John Dover, and may have been admitted to [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]] at [[Cambridge]] in 1595, leaving early to avoid swearing the [[Oath of Supremacy]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{citation |last=Williams |first=Jean |title=The Curious Mystery of the Cotswold 'Olimpick' Games: Did Shakespeare Know Dover ... and Does it Matter? |journal=Sport in History |doi=10.1080/17460260902872602 |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=150–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dover was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]] on 27&amp;nbsp;February 1605, and was probably called to the bar in 1611,&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; the same year he likely moved to Saintbury, near [[Chipping Campden]], with his wife and children.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

It is unclear whether Dover began the Games from scratch, or took over from an existing event, perhaps a [[Parish ale|church ale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The word &quot;ale&quot; was used to describe any kind of festivity or feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Roud |contribution=church ales |title=A Dictionary of English Folklore |year= 2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=online |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t71.e190 |first2=Steve |accessdate=1&amp;nbsp;July 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The Games had the approval of [[James I of England|King James]],&lt;ref name=HaddonPP18-20/&gt; who in his book of advice to his son, ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (1599), had written that to promote good feeling among the common people towards their king, &quot;certain days in the year would be appointed, for delighting the people with public spectacles of all honest games, and exercise of arms&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonP28&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was at that time in England a growing admiration for the ancient Greeks, Dover may have been motivated by military rather than cultural considerations. His biographer, Christopher Whitfield, claimed that Dover combined ancient countryside practices with &quot;classical mythology and Renaissance culture, whilst linking them with the throne and the King's Protestant Church&quot;.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; Dover believed that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the kingdom.&lt;ref name=SwaddlingP104&gt;{{Harvnb|Swaddling|2000|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have believed that the Games would bring rich and poor together, increasing social harmony, an ideal that might explain why the event captured the public imagination.&lt;ref name=HaddonP64&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Writing a few years after the first Games of 1612, Dover himself claimed to be uncertain of his motivations in starting the Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{{quote|I cannot tell what planet ruled, when I&lt;br/&gt;First undertook this mirth, this jollity,&lt;br/&gt;Nor can I give account to you at all,&lt;br&gt;How this conceit into my brain did fall.&lt;/br/&gt;Or how I durst assemble, call together&lt;/br/&gt;Such multitudes of people as come hither.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP47-48&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

[[Endymion Porter]], a member of the court of King James, had an estate in the village of Aston-sub-Edge, close to Dover's home.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP28-29/&gt; Dover acted as Porter's legal agent between 1622 and 1640, and through him James sent some of his own clothes to Dover, &quot;purposely to grace him and consequently the solemnity [of the Games]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; James may also have granted Dover a coat of arms, with the motto &quot;Do Ever Good&quot;, as claimed by Dover's grandson, a claim that was rejected by the heraldic authorities in 1682.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP28-29&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annalia Dubrensia'' (Annals of Dover), a collection of poems praising Dover and his achievements in promoting and managing the Games, was published in 1636. The contributors included well-known poets such as [[Michael Drayton]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[Thomas Randolph (poet)|Thomas Randolph]], and [[Thomas Heywood]].&lt;ref name=HaddonPP54-56&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; They saw the Games as revitalising traditional English social life, and they countered opposition from the critics of such events, who complained of &quot;drunken behaviour and sexual licence&quot;,&lt;ref name=HaddonP25&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; by stressing the &quot;peaceful and well-behaved&quot; nature of the occasion, and even praising the Games as &quot;a gesture of loyalty to the king&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP59-61&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Games had acquired their title of &quot;Olimpicks&quot; by the time the ''Annalia Dubrensia'' was published, a name approved of by Dover. It secularised the proceedings, while adding an air a gentrification to the sports by linking them with the [[ancient Olympic Games|Olympics]] of ancient Greece.&lt;ref name=HaddonP54&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been brought up in a Catholic family, Dover might well have been keen not to draw attention to religion, particularly if the Games had taken over from an earlier church ale.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP53-54&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
{{wide image|Dover's Hill, near Chipping Campden.jpg |800px|A panoramic view of the site of the Games}}

The Games took place in a natural amphitheatre on what is known today as Dover's Hill, then called Kingcombe Plain, above the town of [[Chipping Campden]], in Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP18-20&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were held on the Thursday and Friday of Whit-Week, or the week of [[Whitsun]], which normally fell between mid-May and mid-June. Dover presided over the Games on horseback, dressed ceremonially in a coat, hat, feather and ruff, donated by King James. Horses and men were decorated with Dover's favours, yellow ribbons pinned to a hat or worn around the arm, leg, or neck.&lt;ref name=HaddonP62/&gt; Tents were erected for the [[gentry]], who came from the surrounding counties of [[Gloucestershire]], [[Oxfordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]], and food was supplied in abundance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hackwoodpp1419&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hackwood|1907|pp=14–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet Nicholas Wallington wrote that:
{{quote|He [Dover] spares no cost; this also doth afford&lt;br&gt;To those that sit at any board.&lt;br/&gt;None ever hungry from these Games come home,&lt;br/&gt;Or e'er made plaint of viands, or of room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A temporary wooden building was constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hackwoodpp1419&quot;/&gt; Competitors were summoned to the hillside by the sound of a hunting horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, [[quarterstaff]], and wrestling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hackwoodpp1419&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=SwaddlingP104/&gt; Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP62-63&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contests were refereed by officials called sticklers, from which the phrase &quot;a stickler for the rules&quot; is derived. Sticklers were so-named because they carried sticks, with which to safely separate two fighting swordsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; No scores or times are recorded for any of the events. Portable watches of the time were &quot;rare, costly, and relatively unreliable devices&quot;, but perhaps just as importantly &quot;nobody in Dover's time was much interested in sports record-keeping or record-breaking&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonP90&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors from all strata of society attended, from agricultural labourers to the nobility, some of whom travelled up to {{convert|60|mi}} to attend the Games.&lt;ref name=HaddonP62&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] attended in 1636.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

===Other diversions===
A harper dressed as the Greek poet [[Homer]] entertained the crowds, enhancing the classical Olympic theme. There was also a maze, known as a [[Troy Town]], constructed from piled up turf with walls about {{convert|1|ft}} high, through which villagers would dance. Various games were played for small stakes in booths and tents, including chess, Irish{{spaced ndash}}a game similar to [[backgammon]]{{spaced ndash}}and card games such as cent, a game like [[piquet]]. King James approved of card games &quot;when you have no other thing ado&amp;nbsp;... and are weary of reading&amp;nbsp;... and when it is foul and stormy weather&quot;, but he considered chess to be &quot;too obsessive a game&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP111-119&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=111–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Games ended with a grand firework display, centred on the castle.&lt;ref name=SwaddlingP105&gt;{{Harvnb|Swaddling|2000|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In the 17th century many [[Puritans]] believed that the slightest action might lead to sin, and even to [[Hell]] if it was not repented.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP122-123/&gt; They frowned on festivities such as the Games as being of pagan origin, promoting immorality and drunkenness,&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; and disapproved of any celebration on a church holiday such as Whitsun.&lt;ref name=HaddonP125&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Puritan revolt over a 1627 &quot;Bringing in the May&quot; festival at [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Mount Wollaston]] in present-day [[Massachusetts]] resulted in the expulsion of its organiser from the colony.&lt;ref name=Abrahams&gt;{{citation |last=Abrahams |first=Roger D. |title=Antick Dispositions and the Perilous Politics of Culture: Costume and Culture in Jacobean England and America |jstor=541937 |journal=The Journal of American Folklore, No. 440 |volume=111 |year=1998 |pages=115–132 |publisher=American Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; King James, on the other hand, viewed Puritanism as a challenge to the authority of the monarch.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP124-127&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine clothes donated by the King, which Dover wore when he presided over the Games, were not just a fashion statement, but also a political one.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP122-123&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feather in Dover's hat was a &quot;flag of defiance to virtue&quot; in Puritan eyes, and even the starch probably used in the washing of his ruff was evil, according to the Puritan writer [[Philip Stubbes]]. He described starch as &quot;[a] certain kind of liquid matter&amp;nbsp;... wherein the Devil hath learned them [non-Puritans] to wash and die their ruffs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaddonPP124-127&quot;/&gt;

James was succeeded by King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625. The new king reluctantly consented to an Act of Parliament &quot;for punishing divers abuses on the Lord's Day, called Sunday&quot;. The Act restricted the activities that were allowed to take place on a Sunday, and prohibited any meetings of people outside their own parishes on Sunday. Many Puritan landowners went even further, forbidding their workers to attend any church ales, culminating in two Somerset circuit judges ruling in 1632 that &quot;all public ales be henceforth utterly suppressed&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP145-146&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year Charles reversed the judges' ruling of 1632. He produced a new version of James's ''[[Declaration of Sports|Book of Sports]]'', which he ordered to be read in every church. In it he wrote:
{{quote|We find that under pretence of taking away abuses, there hath been a general forbidding, not only of ordinary meetings, but of the feast of the dedication of the churches, commonly called wakes&amp;nbsp;... Now our express will and pleasure is that these feasts, with others, shall be observed, and that our Justices of the Peace&amp;nbsp;... shall look to it, both that all disorders there may be prevented or punished, and that all neighbourhood and freedom, with man-like and lawful exercises be used.&lt;ref name=HaddonP146-147&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642 brought the Games to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First revival, 1660–1850==

The Games were revived at some uncertain date after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP163-164&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dover had died in 1652,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bereft of his influence, the Games became &quot;just another drunken country festival&quot;, according to an account written by the poet [[William Somervile]] in 1740.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP163-164/&gt; By then the Games, known as Dover's Meeting, were well established and once again quite popular, and included events such as [[backsword]] fighting. It is unclear whether the contestants fought with metal or wooden swords, but there is no doubt that very real danger was involved. During a fight at the beginning of the 19th century, one of the contestants was so badly injured that he died soon afterwards. The wrestling competitions had become shin-kicking contests, with competitors wearing heavily nailed boots, sometimes with pointed tips.&lt;ref name=HaddonP169&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet and writer [[Richard Graves]] described the Games in his picaresque novel ''The Spiritual Quixote'' (1773) as a &quot;heathenish assembly&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonP169&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somervile's account of the 1740 Games describes a general riot in which &quot;chairs, and forms, and battered bowls are hurled/With fell intent; like bombs the bottles fly&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonP164&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves dramatised the enthusiasm for the women's race for a Holland shift displayed on a pole: &quot;six young women began to exhibit themselves before the whole assembly, in a dress hardly reconcilable to the rules of decency&quot;.&lt;ref name=HaddonP167&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1845 the Games were being organised by a local publican, William Drury, who paid £5 for the right to do so. He hired out space for stalls and booths, and presumably sold alcohol at the event. The rector of Weston-sub-Edge, the parish in which Dover's Hill is located, Reverend Geoffrey Drinkwater Bourne, claimed that up to 30,000&amp;nbsp;people were attending the Games by then, and that the hillside was full of drunk and disorderly individuals. Bourne also claimed that:
{{quote|From 1846 onwards, the games, instead of being as they originally were intended to be decorously conducted, became the trysting place of all the lowest scum of the population which lived in the districts lying between Birmingham and Oxford.&lt;ref name=HaddonPP169-170&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Such accounts may have been exaggerated however, as there are few reports of police being called to the Games, and no court records of prosecutions for drunkenness or fighting.&lt;ref name=HaddonP171&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staging of the Games depended on the existence of a suitably large area of [[common land]], but by the mid-19th century much of England's common land was being partitioned up and fenced off. Consent for the [[enclosure]] of the parish of Weston-sub-Edge was given in 1850,&lt;ref name=HaddonP172&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; signalling the end of the Games in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brunton |first=Michael |title=Oddball Olympics |date=4&amp;nbsp;April 2004 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,607766,00.html |publisher=Time.com|accessdate=29&amp;nbsp;June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parish's {{convert|969|acre}} were divided among local farmers and landowners; Reverend Bourne, who a few years earlier had complained so vociferously about the Games, received {{convert|63|acre}}.&lt;ref name=HaddonP172/&gt;

==Shakespearean connection==
Some historians have suggested that the Games were alluded to in playwright [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Hackwoodpp1419&quot;/&gt; and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the [[quarto]] edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous [[First Folio]] of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain whether or not it was written by Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

The first Shakespearean scholars to make a connection between Dover and Shakespeare were [[Samuel Johnson]], [[George Steevens]], [[Thomas Warton]], and [[Edmond Malone]]; historian Jean Wilson has commented that it required &quot;quite imaginative leaps such as a hill referred to by Bolingbroke [King Henry IV of England] being the hill on which the games were held&quot;. More recently, the historian and secretary of the Robert Dover's Games Society, Francis Burns, has suggested that the wrestling scene in ''[[As You Like It]]'' &quot;reflects the wrestling at the Games&quot;.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

Although Shakespeare may have been acquainted with Robert Dover, there is no evidence that he ever attended the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Palmer|Palmer|1999|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966, on the evening of the Friday after [[Spring Bank Holiday]], and attract thousands of visitors. An actor dressed as Dover arrives on horseback to open the games. Events have included the [[tug of war]], [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]], [[shin-kicking]], [[dwile flonking]], motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, [[morris dancing]], and, in 1976, poetry. After dusk a bonfire is lit, followed by a torchlight procession to the square in Chipping Campden,&lt;ref name=HaddonP183&gt;{{Harvnb|Haddon|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the entertainment continues well into the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Robert Dover's Olimpick Games |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=860 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4&amp;nbsp;June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Olympic Association]], in its successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, recognised Dover's Games as &quot;the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings&quot;.&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4&amp;nbsp;June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1972, the athletics coach and sports journalist [[Ron Pickering]] said:
{{quote|The influence of English rural sports, and the work of William Penny Brookes and Robert Dover, have been significant in the development of the Olympic Games philosophy. Almost half the events in the Modern Games are historically connected to British rural sports.

==History==
The [[Slovenia]]n sports instructor [[Metod Klemenc]] founded the International Children's Games in 1968 with the aim to promote peace and friendship through sports to the world's youth. He organised the first International Children's Games and Cultural Festival in 1968 with the participation of teams from nine European cities.

==Current success==
Since that time, 37,000 children aged 12 to 15 have been in competition at 43 Summer Games and 4 Winter Games. 411 different cities, 86 countries and all 5 continents have participated. The International Children's Games and Cultural Festival has become the world's largest international multi-sport youth games, and is a recognised member of the International Olympic Committee.

==Future==
The International Children's Games in 2012 will be held in [[Daegu]], South Korea, followed by Windsor-Essex, Canada in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infowindsor.com/international-childrens-games-windsor|title=Windsor-Essex Awarded International Children's Games 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lake Macquarie]], Australia in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-06-29/lake-macquarie-wins-bid-for-international/885732|title=Lake Macquarie Awarded International Children's Games 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tralee]]/[[County Kerry|Kerry]], Ireland, are preparing a bid to host the International Children's Games in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryicg.org/index.asp|title=Tralee/Kerry Goal To Host International Children's Games 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19550">[[File:Antikes Olympia Stadion.JPG|thumb|300px|Stadium at ancient [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].]]
An '''Olympiad''' is a period of four years associated with the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]].  During the [[Hellenistic period]], beginning with [[Ephorus]], it was used as a [[Epoch (reference date)|calendar epoch]].
By this reckoning, the first Olympiad lasted from the summer of 776 BC to that of 772 BC.
By extrapolation to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the
{{#switch: {{#expr: (({{{1|{{CURRENTYEAR}}}}}+775) mod 5)}}
|0 = 1st
|1 = 2nd
|2 = 3rd
|3 = 4th
}} year of the  {{#expr:(({{{1|{{CURRENTYEAR}}}}}+779)/4 -.5)round 0}}th Olympiad begins in mid-{{CURRENTYEAR}}.

A modern Olympiad refers to a four-year period beginning January 1 of a year in which the [[Summer Olympics]] are due to occur.  The first modern Olympiad began in 1896, the second in 1900, and so on (the 30th began in 2012: see the [http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Olympic%20Charter/Charter_en_2010.pdf Olympic Charter]).

== Ancient Olympics ==
An Olympiad was a period of four years.  Example: Olympiad 140, year 1 = 220/219 BC; year 2 = 219/218 BC; year 3 = 218/217 BC; year 4 = 217/216 BC.

=== Historians ===
The sophist [[Hippias]] was the first writer to publish a list of victors of the Olympic Games, and by the time of [[Eratosthenes]], it was generally agreed that the first Olympic games had happened during the summer of 776 BC.{{Sfn | Bickerman | 1980 | p = 75}}  The combination of victor lists and calculations from 776 BC onwards enabled Greek historians to use the Olympiads as a way of reckoning time that did not depend on the time reckonings of one of the city-states. (''See [[Attic calendar]]''.) The first to do so consistently was [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] of [[Tauromenium]] in the third century BC. Nevertheless, since for events of the early history of the games the reckoning was used in retrospect, some of the dates given by later historian for events before the 5th century BC are very unreliable.{{Sfn | Bickerman | 1980 | p = 88}}  In the 2nd century AD, [[Phlegon of Tralles]] summarised the events of each Olympiad in a book called ''Olympiads'', and an extract from this has been preserved by the [[Byzantine literature|Byzantine]] writer [[Photius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Photius | title = Bibliotheca | publisher = Terlullian | url = http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_03bibliotheca.htm#97 | page = 97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian chroniclers continued to use this Greek system of dating as a way of synchronising [[Bible|biblical]] events with Greek and Roman history.  In the 3rd century AD, [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] compiled a list of Olympic victors up to 217 BC, and this list has been preserved in the Chronicle of [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eusebius | title = Chronicle | url = http://www.attalus.org/translate/eusebius2.html#193 | page = 193 | publisher = Attalus}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of Ancient Olympiad dates ===
[[Image:Relief greek ballplayers 500bC.jpg|thumb|300px|A relief of the Greek Olympiad.]]

* Early historians sometimes used the names of Olympic victors as a method of dating events to a specific year.  For instance, [[Thucydides]] says in his account of the year 428 BC: &quot;It was the Olympiad in which the [[Rhodos|Rhodian]] [[Dorieus (Rhodes)|Dorieus]] gained his second victory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thucydides | title = History of the Peloponnesian War | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+3.8.1 3.8.1 | publisher = Tufts}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] dates the foundation of Rome to 752 BC: &quot;Romulus, the first ruler of the city, began his reign in the first year of the seventh Olympiad, when [[Charops (mythology)|Charops]] at Athens was in the first year of his ten-year term as archon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = of Halicarnassus | first = Dionysius | title = Roman Antiquities | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1D*.html#75 | at = 1.75 | publisher = University of Chicago}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diodorus Siculus]] dates the Persian invasion of Greece to 480 BC: &quot;Calliades was archon in Athens, and the Romans made Spurius Cassius and Proculus Verginius Tricostus consuls, and the Eleians celebrated the Seventy-fifth Olympiad, that in which Astylus of Syracuse won the ''stadion''. It was in this year that king Xerxes made his campaign against Greece.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Diodorus | last = Siculus | title = Historical Library | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/11A*.html#1 | at = 11.1.2 | publisher = University of Chicago}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jerome]], in his [[Latin]] translation of the Chronicle of [[Eusebius]], dates the birth of [[Jesus Christ]] to year 3 of Olympiad 194, the 42nd year of the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]], which equates to the year 2 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jerome | title = Chronological Tables | url = http://www.attalus.org/translate/jerome2.html#2010 | at = year 2015 | publisher = Attalus}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Start of the Olympiad ===
An Olympiad started with the games, which were held at the beginning of the Olympic new year, which was on the [[full moon]] closest to the summer [[solstice]]. (After the introduction of the [[Metonic cycle]] about 432 BC, the start of the Olympic year was determined slightly differently).

=== Anolympiad ===
Though the games were held without interruption, on more than one occasion they were held by others than the Eleiäns. The Eleiäns declared such games ''Anolympiads'' (non-Olympics), but it is assumed the winners were nevertheless recorded.

=== End of the era ===
During the 3rd century AD, records of the games are so scanty that historians are not certain whether after 261 they were still held every four years. During the early years of the Olympiad, any physical benefit deriving from a sport was banned. Some winners were recorded though, until the last Olympiad of 393AD. In 394, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Theodosius I]] outlawed the games at Olympia as pagan. Though it would have been possible to continue the reckoning by just counting four-year periods, by the middle of the 5th century AD reckoning by Olympiads had become disused.

For the modern Olympics the term was long used to indicate the games themselves, but the IOC now uses it to indicate a period of four years.

=== Start and end ===
The modern Olympiad is a period of four consecutive calendar years, beginning on the first of
January of the first year and ending on the thirty-first of December of the fourth year. The Olympiads are numbered consecutively from the first Games of the Olympiad celebrated in Athens in 1896. The XXX Olympiad began on 1 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olympic Charter]] - Bye-law to Rule 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] are more correctly referred to as the Games of the Olympiad. The first [[poster]] to announce the games using this term was the one for the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], in Los Angeles, using the phrase: ''Call to the games of the Xth Olympiad''

Note, however, that the official numbering of the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] does not count Olympiads—- it counts only the Games themselves. For example:
* The first Winter Games, in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]], were not designated as ''Winter Games of the VIII Olympiad'', but as the ''I Winter Olympic Games''.
* The [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Games]] were the ''Games of the XI Olympiad''. After the [[1940 Summer Olympics|1940]] and [[1944 Summer Olympics|1944]] Summer Games were canceled due to [[World War II]], the Games resumed in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] as the ''Games of the XIV Olympiad''.
* However, the [[1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Winter Games]] were the ''IV Winter Olympic Games'', and the resumption of the Winter Games in [[1948 Winter Olympics|1948]] was designated the ''V Winter Olympic Games''.&lt;ref&gt;Team USA: [http://www.teamusa.org/resources/olympic-facts-figures/olympic-games-chronology Olympic Games Chronology].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media people have from time to time referred to a particular (e.g., the ''n''th) Winter Olympics as &quot;the Games of the ''n''th Winter Olympiad&quot;, perhaps believing it to be the correct formal name for the Winter Games by analogy with that of the Summer Games. Indeed, at least one IOC-published article has applied this nomenclature as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/sport-for-all?articleid=124280|title=Community Spirit|first=Nigel|last=Kendall|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|date=2011-04-08|accessdate=2011-06-22|quote=The XXI Winter Olympiad was to be the first 'social media Games'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy is sometimes extended further by media references to &quot;Summer Olympiads&quot;. However, the IOC does not seem to make an official distinction between Olympiads for the summer and winter games, and such usage particularly for the Winter Olympics is not consistent with the numbering discussed above.

=== Quadrennium ===
The [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] often uses the term ''quadrennium'', which it claims refers to the same four-year period. However, it indicates these quadrennia in calendar years, starting with the first year after the Summer Olympics and ending with the year the next Olympics are held. This would suggest a more precise period of four years, but the 2001–2004 Quadrennium would then not be exactly the same period as the [[2000 Summer Olympics|XXVIIth Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;USOC Quadrennial Congressional Report, [http://assets.usoc.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/24822/USOC_Report_to_Congress_-_June_1_2009.pdf June 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural Olympiad ===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
A ''Cultural Olympiad'' is a concept protected by the International Olympic Committee and may be used only within the limits defined by an Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. From one Games to the next, the scale of the Cultural Olympiad varies considerably, sometimes involving activity over the entire Olympiad and other times emphasizing specific periods within it. Baron Pierre de Coubertin established the principle of ‘Olympic Art Competitions’ at a special congress in Paris in 1906, and the first official programme was presented during the 1912 Games in Stockholm. These competitions were also named the ‘Pentathlon of the Muses’, as their purpose was to bring artists to present their work and compete for ‘art’ medals across five categories: architecture, music, literature, sculpture and painting. Nowadays, while there are no competitions as such, cultural and artistic practice is displayed via the Cultural Olympiad.

The 2012 London Olympics included an extensive [[2012 Cultural Olympiad|Cultural Olympiad]] with the [http://festival.london2012.com/ London 2012 Festival]. Cultural events occurred across the British Isles. A major event was the [http://www.worldshakespearefestival.org.uk/ World Shakespeare Festival] produced by the [[RSC]] and including the [[Globe to Globe Festival]].

==== CODE ====
At the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver, Cultural Olympiad presented the [[Cultural Olympiad Digital Edition]] (or CODE for short). Conforming with the tag-line &quot;Connect.Create.Collaborate.&quot;, the festival brought both national and international artists to present digital art, music, and cinema.

== Other uses ==
The English term is still often used popularly to indicate the games themselves, a usage that is strictly erroneous (as an Olympiad is the time period ''between'' games) but widely accepted nevertheless. It is also used to indicate international competitions other than physical [[sport]]s. This includes [[international science olympiads]], such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] and the [[International Linguistics Olympiad]] and their associated national qualifying tests (e.g., the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad]] or the [[North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad]]), and also events in mind-sports, such as the [[Science Olympiad]], [[Mind Sports Olympiad|Mindsport Olympiad]], [[Chess Olympiad]] and [[Computer Olympiad]]. In these cases ''Olympiad'' is used to indicate a regular event of international competition; it does not necessarily indicate a four-year period.

In some languages, like [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], Olympiad ({{lang-cs|olympiáda}}) is the correct term for the games.

''The Olympiad'' (''[[L'Olimpiade]]'') is also the name of some 60 [[opera]]s, of which the plot is set in Ancient Greece.

      <comment>moving the non-olympic (played) sports down to focus on what is done olympically</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23263">The participation of '''women at the Olympics''' has always been below 50%. It has risen from about 10% until World War II to 45% in 2012. Certain sports that have been historically popular with women often are not included in the Olympics or are only recent additions to the games. The 2012 Olympics were the first Games in which all disciplines had both a male and a female equivalent. The Olympics made it harder to get new sports included in Olympic programme.
[[File:Women percent summer olympics.png|frame|Women participants at each [[Summer Olympic Games]] as a percentage of all participants]]
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Attending the games==
In some countries like Australia, getting funding for women to participate in the Olympics during the early years of the Games was difficult.  Twenty years ago, the Australian swimming federation did not want to spend money to send female athletes to compete in the games; rather, they wanted to spend money to fund more participation of male swimmers.&lt;ref name=HHowell-26&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|Howell|1988|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Historically, coverage and inclusion of women's team sports in the Olympics has been limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones-143&quot;/&gt; Instead, the media focuses on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones-143&quot;/&gt;

==The Games==
===Rome 1960===
The role American women at the Olympics gained in importance and visibility compared to their male American peers.&lt;ref name=Maraniss-xiii&gt;{{harvnb|Maraniss|2008|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{incomplete|section|date=July 2012}}
===Basketball===

Women's basketball has been contested in the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] since [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Boxing===
Women's boxing was first introduced at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] with [[Nicola Adams]] winning the first boxing gold medal in [[Boxing at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's flyweight|the flyweight division]].

===Cycling===
While men's [[road cycling|road]] and [[track cycling]] have been Olympic disciplines since the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896, there were no women's cycling events in the Olympic programme until the [[Cycling at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Games]] in Los Angeles when [[Cycling at the 1984 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race|the first women's road race]] was held. The first track cycling event for women followed in 1988, but the 2012 London Games will be the first with equal numbers of events for men and women, which entailed a reduction in the number of men's events as well as an increase in the number of women's events. The disciplines of [[mountain biking]] and [[BMX]] were introduced in 1996 and 2008 respectively, with separate men's and women's events from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTI2Mjc&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NzU5ODg&amp;LangId=1|first=Pat|last=McQuaid|authorlink=Pat McQuaid|contribution=The equal opportunities: How to make it happen|title=5th World Conference on Women and Sport|month=February|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice hockey===
[[File:Hayley Wickenheiser cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Canadian [[Hayley Wickenheiser]] is the all-time leading scorer in the women's tournament&lt;ref name=ice-hockey1&gt;{{harvnb|The Canadian Press|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named tournament MVP twice.&lt;ref name=yen&gt;{{harvnb|Yen|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At the [[List of IOC meetings|99th IOC Session]] in July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event beginning with the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] as part of their effort to increase the number of female athletes at the Olympics.&lt;ref name=ice-hockey1&gt;{{harvnb|The Canadian Press|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's hockey had not been in the programme when Nagano, Japan had won the right to host the Olympics, and the decision required approval by the Nagano Winter Olympic Organizing Committee (NWOOC). The NWOOC was initially hesitant to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament and because they felt their team, which had failed to qualify for [[1992 IIHF Women's World Championship|that year's World Championships]], could not be competitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agreement&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Glynis Peters, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]]'s (CAHA) head of female hockey, &quot;the Japanese would have to finance an entirely new sports operation to bring their team up to Olympic standards in six years, which they were also really reluctant to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Approval&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ormsby|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1992, the NWOOC and IOC Coordination Committee reached an agreement to include a women's ice hockey tournament in the programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agreement&quot;/&gt; Part of the agreement was that the tournament would be limited to six teams, and no additional facilities would be built. The CAHA also agreed to help build and train the Japanese team so that it could be more competitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Approval&quot;/&gt; The IOC had agreed that if the NWOOC had not approved the event, it would be held at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Agreement&quot;/&gt; The format of the first tournament was similar to the men's: preliminary round-robin games followed by a medal round playoff.&lt;ref name=ice-hockey-3&gt;{{harvnb|sports-reference.com|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fanny Durack]] was Australia's first female gold medalist.&lt;ref name=HHowell-24&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|Howell|1988|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She earned this medal at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]],&lt;ref name=HHowell-25&gt;{{harvnb|Howell|Howell|1988|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she represented a combined team of Australia and New Zealand, known as the Australasian team.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHowell-26&quot;/&gt;

Participation costs for Australian athletes, costs like travel to and lodging at, early Olympic games were expected to be paid by the local sport federation sponsoring the athlete.&lt;ref name=HHowell-26/&gt;

In early Australian swimming history as it pertains to the Olympics, there was an attempt to prevent women from participating by male Australian swimming administrators.&lt;ref name=HHowell-25/&gt;

|quote=Netball is an amazing sport and it was very sad for us for it not to be in the Olympic Games so it would be amazing if we could get it in next time round. It would be brilliant for the girls coming through to get that opportunity to play at the Olympics because it is the sporting pinnacle if you can achieve that goal.

Throughout the history of the Olympics, sports popular exclusively with women or that have been very popular with women have been excluded.&lt;ref name=Dyer-205&gt;{{harvnb|Dyer|1982|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation extends beyond the popular women's sport of netball to women's cycling, which was excluded for many years despite having world championships for women being organised by 1958.&lt;ref name=Dyer-205/&gt; It extends to [[field hockey]], a sport included for men as early as 1908 but not competed by women until 1980.&lt;ref name=Dyer-205/&gt; [[Lawn bowls]] is a popular women's sport that has been included in the [[Commonwealth Games]] for many years but has not made the Olympic program.&lt;ref name=Dyer-205/&gt; While primarily a sport for women, netball allows for mixed gendered teams,&lt;ref name=Symons-122&gt;{{harvnb|Symons|Hemphill|2006|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=samoa-men&gt;{{harvnb|Samoa Observer|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Olympics do not allow mixed gendered team sports.&lt;ref name=Dyer-205/&gt;{{#tag:ref |While team mixed gendered sports are not competed at the Olympics, some mixed gendered events are included.  They include equestrian sports, shooting and sailing where men and women compete against each other.  In shooting and sailing, women were originally only allowed to competed in mixed gendered events.  Single gender events for these sports were not added until a later date.&lt;ref name=ioc-2008-5&gt;{{harvnb|International Olympic Committee|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=&quot;mixed-sports&quot; |group=&quot;note&quot;}}

The issues facing netball are part of a larger problem involving female participation in the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Dyer-205/&gt; At the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], there were 159 sports for men to compete in, but only 86 sports for women, and 12 sports for both men and women.&lt;ref name=pfistertews-274&gt;{{harvnb|Pfister|Hartmann-Tews|2002|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], there were still sports that women were excluded from participating in, such as [[boxing]], [[wrestling]] and [[baseball]]; softball was included as a women-only event. The issue of male over-representation in terms of total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, more male athletes than female athletes received financial support. Sports officials rationalised this uneven distribution of funding by claiming that there are more opportunities for men to win on the highest level than there are comparable opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=pfistertews-274/&gt; The importance of netball being included as a competition sport in the Summer Olympics has been compared to [[softball]], and the benefits that the sport derived from Olympic inclusion.&lt;ref name=Taylor-15&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2001a|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This included additional media attention and television coverage, especially during Olympic years.&lt;ref name=Taylor-15/&gt; Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world.&lt;ref name=FNB-2010&gt;{{harvnb|First National Bank|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also plays an important role in providing recognition to and opportunities for females that may not be available otherwise.&lt;ref name=FNB-2010/&gt;

The selection of women's teams sport in the Olympics may not match with interest levels in a country.&lt;ref name=Jones-143&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia for example, 245,300 total women and girls play basketball, hockey, soccer, softball and volleyball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones-143&quot;/&gt; This compares to 319,500 women and girls who play netball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones-143&quot;/&gt;

===Funding===
The lack of Olympic recognition hampered the globalisation of the game in developing countries,&lt;ref name=Crocombe-156&gt;{{harvnb|Crocombe|1992|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the Olympic Solidarity Movement provides access to funding for these nations through the [[International Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref name=Crocombe-156/&gt; In some countries such as Tanzania, the lack of access to Olympic funding cut off other funding options such funding by [[British Council]].&lt;ref name=Massoa-120&gt;{{harvnb|Massoa|Fasting|2002|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; With official recognition, funding from the IOC, the Olympic Solidarity Movement and the British Council became available to cover costs for travel to international competitions.&lt;ref name=Crocombe-156/&gt; For some nations, without that assistance, trying to maintain international calibre teams was difficult.&lt;ref name=Crocombe-156/&gt; Olympic recognition brought money for development into the sport.&lt;ref name=Shooting-2004&gt;{{harvnb|Shooting for Success|2004|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, IFNA received a grant of {{US$|10000}} from the IOC for development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shooting-2004&quot;/&gt; IFNA was given an additional {{US$|3300}} a year until 2007 by the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports (ARISF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shooting-2004&quot;/&gt;

Beyond access to funds from the International Olympic Committee, Olympic recognition is often a requirement for getting funding from state and national sporting bodies, and state and federal governments. This has been the case in Australia,&lt;ref name=ascstatus-92&gt;{{harvnb|Australian Sport Commission|Office of the Status of Women|1985|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=cpacdpobc-5&gt;{{harvnb|Community, Sport and Cultural Development - Province of British Columbia|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the [[Australian Sports Commission]] and the [[Office of the Status of Women]] identified five criteria for obtaining federal funding.&lt;ref name=ascstatus-92/&gt; One of these was: &quot;status as an Olympic sport and its size by registrations.&quot;&lt;ref name=ascstatus-92/&gt;{{#tag:ref |Netball qualified for funding because it met the other criteria. From 1980 to 1984, the sport received {{A$|497,000}} in funding.&lt;ref name=ascstatus-92/&gt;|name=&quot;au-netball-funding&quot; |group=&quot;note&quot;}} In British Columbia, one of the guidelines says that in order to receive funding, &quot;The sport must be on the program for either the 2011 or 2013 Canada Games and/or the next scheduled recognized International Multi-Sport Games (Olympics/Paralympics, Pan American or Commonwealth Games, Special Olympic World Games);&quot;&lt;ref name=cpacdpobc-5/&gt;

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the [[United States at the 2012 Summer Olympics|American]] team, for the first time, had more female athletes, 269, than male, 261.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/london-olympics-team-usa-women-outnumber-men_n_1663450.html | title=U.S.A Olympic Team: American Women Outnumber Men On London 2012 Delegation | work=Huffington Post | date=July 10, 2012 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=July 13, 2012 | location=Colorado Springs, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}

The '''Paralympic Games''' is a major international [[multi-sport event]], involving athletes with a range of physical and intellectual [[disability|disabilities]], including mobility disabilities, [[amputations]], [[blindness]], and [[cerebral palsy]]. There are [[Winter Paralympic Games|Winter]] and [[Summer Paralympic Games]], which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held immediately following the respective [[Olympic Games]]. All Paralympic Games are governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC).

The Paralympics have grown from a small gathering of British [[World War II]] veterans in [[Stoke Mandeville Games|1948]] to become one of the largest international sporting events by the early 21st century. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes. 

The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with the [[Olympic Games]], while the [[IOC]]-recognized [[Special Olympics World Games]] include athletes with [[intellectual disabilities]], and the [[Deaflympics]] include [[deaf]] athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deaflympics.com/news/publishedarticles.asp?ID=1131 The World Games for the Deaf and the Paralympic Games], [[International Committee of Sports for the Deaf]] (CISS), December, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=specialolympics&gt;[http://info.specialolympics.org/NR/rdonlyres/eygdoyu6qeskkk3pn56u5u62q2wo5alfxtsakkwc56svfiy3qzsgyukawqyplsdx2xxyphk24bx7nznqjvg7t4snyee/olympic_brochure.pdf Special Olympics and the Olympic Movement], Official website of the [[Special Olympics]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The present formal explanation for the name &quot;Paralympic&quot; is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, ''pará'' (&quot;beside&quot; or &quot;alongside&quot;) and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutipc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/|title=About the IPC|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1988 Summer Paralympics|Summer Games of 1988]] held in Seoul was the first time the term &quot;Paralympic&quot; came into official use.

Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have, there are several categories in which the athletes compete.  The allowable disabilities are broken down into six broad categories.  The categories are amputee, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, wheelchair, visually impaired, and ''Les Autres'' (literally &quot;The Others&quot;, which are athletes with disabilities that do not fall into the other five categories; these include [[dwarfism]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[congenital disorder]]s). These categories are further broken down into classifications, which vary from sport to sport. The classification system has led to cheating controversies revolving around athletes who over-stated their disabilities, in addition to the use of performance-enhancing drugs seen in other events.

==History==

===Forerunners===
{{Further|World Wheelchair and Amputee Games}}

[[File:Sir Ludwig Guttmann.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[Ludwig Guttmann]]]]
Athletes with disabilities did compete in the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics.  The first athlete to do so was [[German American]] gymnast [[George Eyser]] in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]], who had one artificial leg. [[Hungary at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Hungarian]] [[Karoly Takacs]] competed in shooting events in both the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] Summer Olympics.  He was a right-arm amputee and could shoot left-handed.  Another disabled athlete to appear in the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was [[Liz Hartel]], a [[Denmark at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Danish]] equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the [[Equestrian at the 1952 Summer Olympics|dressage]] event.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first organized athletic day for disabled athletes that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, United Kingdom.  [[Germans|German born]] Dr. [[Ludwig Guttmann]] of [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessibleportugal.com/revista/2008/Setembro/capa1.html Paralympics History]{{dead link|date=April 2011}} By Susana Correia in Accessible Portugal Online Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; who had been helped to flee Nazi Germany by the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics]] (CARA) in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsl.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/spsl/spsl.html#spsl.A |title=SPSL Archive |publisher=Rsl.ox.ac.uk |date=1933-12-24 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted a sports competition for British [[World War II]] veteran patients with spinal cord injuries. The first games were called the [[World Wheelchair and Amputee Games|1948 International Wheelchair Games]], and were intended to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympics]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Paralympic Movement|publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympiceducation.ca/Content/History/11%20History%20of%20the%20Paralympics.asp?langid=1|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Guttman's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  The games were held again at the same location in 1952, and Dutch veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its kind. These early competitions, also known as the Stoke Mandeville Games, have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005), pp.38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milestones===
There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement. The first official Paralympic Games, no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in [[1960 Summer Paralympics|1960]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympics traces roots to Second World War|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/09/02/f-paralympics-history.html|accessdate=2010-04-14 | date=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  400 athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galligan (2000), pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the [[1976 Summer Paralympics|1976 Summer Games]], athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;  The [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, was another milestone for the Paralympic movement.  It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic Summer Games]], in the same host city, and using the same facilities.  This set a precedent that was followed in [[1992 Summer Paralympics|1992]], [[1996 Summer Paralympics|1996]] and [[2000 Summer Paralympics|2000]]. It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 2001,&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and was recently extended through 2020.&lt;ref name=bbc-firstglobal&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympics 2012: London to host 'first truly global Games'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/18143145|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[1992 Winter Paralympics]] were the first Winter Games to use the same facilities as the [[1992 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]].

===Winter Games===
{{Main|Winter Paralympic Games}}

The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in [[1976 Winter Paralympics|1976]] in [[Örnsköldsvik]], Sweden.  This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete.&lt;ref name=winterhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Paralympic Games|publisher=Government of Canada|url=http://www.canada2010.gc.ca/101/histor/010203-eng.cfm|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were. This tradition was upheld until the [[1992 Winter Paralympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France; after that, beginning with the [[1994 Winter Paralympics|1994 Games]], the Winter Paralympics and the [[Winter Olympics]] have been held in those even numbered years separate from the Summer Games.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;

===Recent games===
The Paralympic Games were designed to emphasize the participants' athletic achievements, not their disability.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutipc&quot;/&gt; The movement has grown dramatically since its early days – for example the number of athletes participating in the Summer Paralympic Games has increased from 400 athletes in Rome in 1960 to over 3,900 athletes from 146 countries in Beijing in [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Games|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Paralympic_Games/|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games are recognized on the world stage. The Paralympics is no longer held solely for British war veterans or just for athletes in wheelchairs, but for elite athletes with a wide variety of disabilities from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympics history|last=Rosner|first=David|publisher=CNNSI.com|work=Sports Illustrated|date=2000-10-18|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/paralympics/news/2000/10/18/paralympic_history/|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Paralympic Committee==
{{Main|International Paralympic Committee}}

===Forerunners (1964–1989)===
The first organization dedicated to advancement of athletic opportunities for people with a disability was the [[International Sports Organization for the Disabled]] (ISOD), founded in 1964.  The founders of this organization intended it to be a governing body to disability sports what the IOC was to the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  This committee eventually became the [[International Coordinating Committee of World Sports Organizations for the Disabled]] (ICC), which was established in 1982.  The ICC was tasked with advocating for the rights of athletes with a disability in front of the IOC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howe 2008, p. 43&quot;&gt;Howe (2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the cooperative effort between the ICC and the IOC, which resulted in the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, the ICC determined the need to expand and include representatives from all nations that had disability sports programs.  They also deemed it necessary to include athletes in the decisions of the Paralympic governing body. Consequently this body was reorganized as the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) in 1989.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howe 2008, p. 43&quot;/&gt;

===IPC (since 1989)===
[[File:Germany Bonn IPC 2009 06 28.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A white building with trees next to it fronting a street with a car driving past|IPC headquarters in [[Bonn]]]]
The IPC is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. It comprises 174 National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations.  The president of the IPC is [[Philip Craven]], a former Paralympian from Great Britain. In his capacity as head of the IPC, Craven is also a member of the International Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Philip Craven|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Members/Sir-Philip-CRAVEN-MBE/|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPC's international headquarters are in [[Bonn]], Germany.  The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games.  It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports. This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutipc&quot;/&gt;  Subsumed under the authority of the IPC are a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations. The IPC also recognizes media partners, certifies officials, judges, and is responsible for enforcing the bylaws of the [[Paralympic Charter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;movement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC_Handbook/|title=IPC Handbook|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=2010-04-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100421005428/http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC_Handbook/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPC has a cooperative relationship with the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). Delegates of the IPC are also members of the IOC and participate on IOC committees and commissions. The two governing bodies remain distinct, with separate Games, despite the close working relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Schantz (2008) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and symbols==
[[File:Paralympic-flag.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A flag with three red, gree, and blue swooshes on a white background.  It is attached to a flag pole and is framed by a blue sky|The [[Paralympic flag]]]]
{{Main|Paralympic symbols}}

The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, ''pará'' (&quot;beside&quot; or &quot;alongside&quot;) and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryofIPC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/TheIPC/HWA/HistoryoftheMovement|title=History of the Movement|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1988 Summer Paralympics|Summer Games of 1988]] held in Seoul was the first time the term &quot;Paralympic&quot; came into official use.

“Spirit in Motion” is the motto for the Paralympic movement.  The symbol for the Paralympics contains three colours, red, blue, and green, which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations.  The colours are each in the shape of an ''Agito'' (which is Latin for &quot;I move&quot;), an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement.  The three Agitos circle a central point, which is a symbol for the athletes congregating from all points of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Symbol &amp; Motto|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Paralympic_Symbol_Motto.html|accessdate=2010-04-07}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions.  The change was intended to convey the idea that Paralympians have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and is moving forward to achieve it.  The vision of the IPC is, &quot;To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (2008), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The Paralympic anthem is &quot;Hymn de l'Avenir&quot; or &quot;Anthem of the Future&quot;.  It was composed by [[Thierry Darnis]] and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC Intellectual Property Rights|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|format=PDF|url=http://www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/IPC_Handbook/Section_1/2010_03_10_Intellectual_Property_Bylaws_GB_Approved.pdf|accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==

===Opening===
[[File:Paralympics Opening Ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A portion of the stadium with stands full of people, a large artificial tree is on the right side of the image.  A group of people are walking together on the stadium floor|Opening ceremony of the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Athens]]]] 

As mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. Most of these rituals were established at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol1&gt;{{cite web|title= The Modern Olympic Games |chapter= The development of the Games – Between festival and tradition |publisher= International Olympic Committee |page= 5 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf |chapterurl= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf#pages=5 |format= PDF |accessdate= 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture.

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the games. Finally, the Paralympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier—often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation—who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic opening ceremony to be 'family friendly'|publisher=Canwest News Service|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=2010-03-12|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Paralympic+opening+ceremony+family+friendly/2676023/story.html|accessdate=2010-05-03|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100317140459/http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Paralympic+opening+ceremony+family+friendly/2676023/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing===
The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.
The [[Paralympic flag]] is taken down. The national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played.  The games are officially closed, and the Paralympic flame is extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:gYE3_zHFNG4J:www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/IPC_Handbook/Section_1/2009_11_20_Intellectual_Property_Bylaws_GB_approved.pdf+IPC+Handbook+June+2009+Bylaws+Governance+and+Organizational+and+Organizational+Structure,&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiWjg41x66Augn939CIag30vfielmgvqkGvzutyt2JY14aQsNRFV8bL4vbCOx4T2bc2BbDPuMHJgrbh3qy0H3lYiiR6PGTtQe9R58CERqilz0voxEZ72xzSyyLEydWvz8fngwQI&amp;sig=AHIEtbS09CRj9i0kliXh-yulUy3h8fqCHQ IPC Handbook June 2009 Bylaws Governance and Organizational and Organizational Structure] (Google Quick View), [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC)&lt;/ref&gt;  After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.

===Medal presentation===
[[Image:2010 Winter Paralympics Men's Biathlon pursuit vi medalists.jpg|thumb|alt=six men stand together wearing Paralympic medals and waving flower bouquets|A medal ceremony during the 2010 Winter Paralympics.]]

A medal ceremony is held after each Paralympic event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. After the medals are given out by an IPC member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medallists country plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/victory-ceremony-podiums-at-2010-winter-games-a-testament--to-the-mountains-athletes-have-climbed-en-route-to-olympic-and-paralympic-success_264996fr.html Victory Ceremony podiums at 2010 Winter Games a testament to the mountains athletes have climbed en route to Olympic and Paralympic success], The Official website of the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceremony volunteers|publisher=Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/work-and-volunteer/volunteer-opportunities/ceremonies-volunteers/ Ceremonies Volunteers|accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every Paralympic event, the respective medal ceremony is held, at most, one day after the event's final.

==Equality==

===Relationship with the Olympics===
In 2001 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This agreement will remain in effect until the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt; and will be further extended to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=agreement&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation|accessdate=2010-05-03}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its [[Olympic Charter|charter]], which states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Charter|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|page=11|year=2010|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Olympic%20Charter/Charter_en_2010.pdf|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play....Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.}}
While the charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability; given the language in the charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to infer that discrimination on the basis of disability would be against the ideals of the Olympic Charter and the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Schantz (2008) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also consistent with the Paralympic Charter, which forbids discrimination on the basis of political, religious, economic, disability, gender, sexual orientation or racial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Vision and Mission|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|format=PDF|year=2003|url=http://www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/IPC_Handbook/Section_1/Sec_i_chapter_1.1_Paralympic_Vision_and_Mission.pdf|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairman of the [[London organising committee]], [[Sebastian Coe]], said about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, England, that {{cquote|We want to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/may/04/sainsburys-sponsors-paralympic-games | location=London | title=Sainsbury's announces sponsorship of 2012 Paralympics | date=2010-05-04 | work=The Guardian | first=Owen | last=Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paralympians at the Olympics====
[[Image:Oscar Pistorius-2.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in a spandex singlet runs on a track.  He has two prosthetics below the knees|upright|right|[[Oscar Pistorius]] at a track meet on 8 July 2007]]
{{See also|List of athletes who have competed in the Paralympics and Olympics}}
[[Paralympian|Paralympic athletes]] have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games.  The precedent was set by [[Neroli Fairhall]], a Paralympic archer from [[New Zealand at the Paralympics|New Zealand]], who competed at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Neroli Fairhall, Champion Archer, Dies at 61|publisher=NYTimes.com|work=The New York Times|date=2006-06-13|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/13/sports/13fairhall.html|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Oscar Pistorius]], a [[South Africa at the Paralympics|South African]] sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by [[Ossur]]. He holds Paralympic records in the 100, 200, and 400&amp;nbsp;meter events. 
Pistorius missed qualifying for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in the 400&amp;nbsp;meter race, by 0.70&amp;nbsp;seconds. He qualified for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] where he won gold medals in the 100, 200, and 400&amp;nbsp;meter sprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=An Amputee Sprinter: Is He Disabled to Too-Abled|last=Longman|first=Jere|publisher=NYTimes.com|work=The New York Times|date=2007-05-15|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/sports/othersports/15runner.html|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Pistorius qualified for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and competed in two events: he made the semi-final in the [[400 metres]] race; and his team came 8th in the final of the [[4 × 400 metres relay]] race.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paralympics 100m: Oscar Pistorius says past experience vital|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/18146074|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some athletes without a disability also compete at the Paralympics; The [[sighted guide]]s for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/sports/article/779425--visually-impaired-skiers-put-fate-in-guide-s-hands Visually impaired skiers put fate in guide's hands], thestar.com, March 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
There has been criticism for not providing equal funding to Paralympic athletes as compared to Olympic athletes.  An example of this criticism was a lawsuit filed by Paralympic athletes [[Tony Iniguez]], [[Scot Hollonbeck]] and [[Jacob Heilveil]] of the [[United States at the Paralympics|United States]], in 2003.&lt;ref name=court&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/sports/othersports/07paralympics.html Court Lets Ruling Stand in U.S.O.C. Case], [[New York Times]], October 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They alleged that the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC), which also include the USOC Paralympic Division (the National Paralympic Committee), was underfunding American Paralympic athletes. Iniguez cited the fact that the USOC made healthcare benefits available to a smaller percentage of Paralympians, the USOC provided smaller quarterly training stipends and paid smaller financial awards for medals won at a Paralympics. US Paralympians saw this as a disadvantage for the US Paralympic athletes, as nations such as Canada and Britain supported Paralympians and Olympians virtually equally. The USOC did not deny the discrepancy in funding and contended that this was due to the fact that it did not receive any government financial support.  As a result it had to rely on revenue generated by the media exposure of its athletes.  Olympic athletic success resulted in greater exposure for the USOC than Paralympic athletic achievements.  The case was heard by lower courts, who ruled that the USOC has the right to allocate its finances to athletes at different rates.  The case was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympic Athletes Add Equality to Their Goals|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|publisher=NYTimes.com|work=The New York Times|date=2008-09-05|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/sports/othersports/06paralympics.html|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; where on September 6, 2008 it announced that it would not hear the appeal. However, during the time the lawsuit lasted (from 2003 to 2008), the funding from the USOC had nearly tripled. In 2008 $11.4&amp;nbsp;million was earmarked for Paralympic athletes, up from $3&amp;nbsp;million in 2004.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

As with the Olympics, recent Paralympics have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors. Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms.&lt;ref name=paralympic-twists&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Paralympics reignite the Olympic buzz but with added twists|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/london-paralympics-olympics-differences-similiarities?newsfeed=true|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], the Paralympics have been unable to maintain a consistent international media presence.

Television broadcasts of Paralympic Games began in 1976, but this early coverage was confined to taped-delay releases to one nation or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics there were 45&amp;nbsp;hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman and Darcy (2008), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 Paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for the Paralympic Games.  A deal was reached between the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) and All Media Sports (AMS) to broadcast the Games internationally.  Deals were reached with Asian, South American, and European broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible. The Games were also webcast for the first time. Because of these efforts the Sydney Paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman and Darcy (2008), pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant was the fact that the organizers did not have to pay networks to televise the Games as had been done at the [[1992 Summer Paralympics|1992]] and [[1996 Summer Paralympics|1996]] Games.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin and Newell (2003), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these advances consistent media attention has been a challenge, which was evidenced in the coverage in Great Britain of the [[2010 Winter Paralympics]].

The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) was criticized for its minimal coverage of the 2010 Winter Paralympics as compared to its coverage of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. The BBC announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one-hour highlight program after the Games ended. For the Winter Olympics the BBC aired 160 hours of coverage. The response from the BBC was that budget constraints and the &quot;time zone factor&quot; necessitated a limited broadcast schedule.&lt;ref name=bbcmedia&gt;{{Cite news|title=BBC criticised for scant coverage of Winter Paralympics|last=Sweney|first=Mark|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|date=2010-03-12|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/12/bbc-criticised-coverage-winter-paralympics|accessdate=2010-04-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], which was watched by 23% of the population of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=bbcmedia/&gt; In Norway, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK) broadcast 30 hours of the 2010 Winter Games live.

NRK were far more pleased with the production of the [[ice sledge hockey]] and [[wheelchair curling]] events, which they felt reached the same level as the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ht.no/incoming/ntb/sport/article345233.ece Oppgitt over elendig Paralympics-produksjon] (Norwegian), [[Harstad Tidende]], March 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial broadcaster [[Channel 4]] acquired the rights to the Paralympics in the United Kingdom for the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], and planned to air extensive coverage of the games; Channel 4 aired 150 hours of coverage, and also offered [[mobile app]]s, and three dedicated streaming channels of additional coverage on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Freesat]], [[Virgin Media]] and Channel 4's website.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/unprecedented-rolling-coverage-london-2012 |title=Unprecedented Rolling Coverage for London 2012 &amp;#124; IPC |publisher=Paralympic.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 4 also made a push to heighten the profile of the Paralympics in the country by producing a 2 minute trailer for its coverage, &quot;Meet the Superhumans&quot;; which premièred simultaneously on over 70 commercial channels in the UK on 17 July 2012.&lt;ref name=adott-c4paralympics&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad of the Day: Paralympic Games Forget the Olympics.

[[United States|American]] broadcaster [[NBC Sports]], who also owns the broadcast rights to the Olympics, has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing only a bare minimum of coverage from the Paralympics; the lack of coverage from NBC in [[2004 Summer Paralympics|Athens]] was a cause for concern from senior IPC officials, especially given that the United States was [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|bidding for the 2012 Games]].

===Outside the games===
A 2010 study by the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) on the Olympic Games Impact (OGI), showed that of roughly 1,600 Canadian respondents, 41–50 percent believed the [[2010 Winter Paralympics|2010 Paralympic]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Vancouver, Canada]] triggered additional accessibility of buildings, sidewalks and public spaces. 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities.

==Classification==
{{Main|Disability sport classification}}
[[Image:Paralympic XC ski sitting.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A woman sitting on sit-skis, she is pushing herself with two poles|[[Olena Iurkovska]] of [[Ukraine at the 2010 Winter Paralympics|Ukraine]] competing on cross-country sit-skis at the 2010 Winter Paralympics.]]

The [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) has established ten disability categories. Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport.

===Categories===
The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category.  These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics.&lt;ref name=&quot;paralympic.org&quot;&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120716152047682_ClassificationGuide_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical Impairment''' - There are eight different types of physical impairment:
* '''Impaired muscle power''' - With impairments in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as the muscles of one limb, one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced, e.g. due to spinal-cord injury, [[spina bifida]] or [[polio]].
* '''Impaired passive range of movement''' - Range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way. Acute conditions such as [[arthritis]] are not included.
* '''Loss of limb or limb deficiency''' - A total or partial absence of bones or joints from [[amputation|partial or total loss]] due to illness, trauma, or congenital limb deficiency (e.g. [[dysmelia]]).
* '''Leg-length difference''' - Significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency or trauma.
* '''Short stature''' - Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs, arms and trunk, which are due to a musculoskeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures.
* '''[[Hypertonia]]''' - Hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system (e.g. cerebral palsy).
* '''[[Ataxia]]''' - Ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]], [[Friedreich’s ataxia]]).
* '''[[Athetosis]]''' - Athetosis is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]], [[choreoathetosis]]).

'''Visual Impairment''' -  Athletes with [[visual impairment]] ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged [[legal blindness|legally blind]], to total [[blindness]]. This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex).&lt;ref name=&quot;paralympic.org&quot;/&gt; The [[sighted guide]]s for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides (along with sighted [[goalkeepers]] in [[5-a-side football]] became eligible to receive medals of their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-ablebodied&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19422244 |title=Paralympics 2012: The able-bodied athletes at the Games |publisher=BBC News |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual Disability''' - Athletes with a significant [[developmental disability|impairment in intellectual functioning]] and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability has been added to some Paralympic Games. This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;paralympic.org&quot;/&gt; However, the [[IOC]]-recognized [[Special Olympics World Games]] are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name=specialolympics/&gt;&lt;ref name=categories&gt;{{Cite news|title=Making sense of the categories |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=2000-10-06 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/paralympics/959701.stm |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification system===
Within the disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to level of impairment.  The classification systems differ from sport to sport and are intended to open up sports to as many athletes as possible who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability. The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities.  Consequently, there is a range of impairment within most classifications .&lt;ref name=classdescribed&gt;{{cite web|title=Athlete Classification|publisher=Australian Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/Classification/AthleteClassification.aspx|accessdate=2010-04-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100217162608/http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/Classification/AthleteClassification.aspx &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical classification (until 1980s)====
From its inception until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment. An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in.  For example an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation.  The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis.  It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete.&lt;ref name=classification&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of classification|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|format=PDF|url=http://www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/Sport/Classification/2010_04_22_x1x_History.pdf|accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Functional classification (since 1980s)====
[[File:Goalball vid Paralympics i Aten.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three men wearing eye shades laying on the floor, a red ball is to the left of the image|The Swedish goalball team at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]]]]

While there is no clear date when the shift occurred, a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s.  In a functional system the focus is on what impact the athlete's impairment has on his or her athletic performance.  Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial.  The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by [[International Blind Sport Federation]] (IBSF0), which still uses a medically based system.&lt;ref name=classification/&gt;

Some sports are only held for certain disability types.  For example, [[Goalball at the Summer Paralympics|goalball]] is only for visually impaired athletes.  The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment, consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or &quot;black out mask&quot; so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goalball|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/IOSD_Sports/Goalball/index.html|accessdate=2010-04-08}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sports, like [[Athletics at the Summer Paralympics|athletics]], are open to athletes with a wide variety of impairments.  In athletics participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment.  For example: classes 11–13 are for visually impaired athletes, which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Athletics|publisher=Australian Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/SportProfiles/Athletics.aspx|accessdate=2010-04-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100118115126/http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/SportProfiles/Athletics.aspx &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are also team competitions such as [[Wheelchair rugby at the Summer Paralympics|wheelchair rugby]].  Members of the team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation.  A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score. A team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on the field of play at the same time to ensure equal competition. For example, in wheelchair rugby the five players' combined disability number must total no more than eight points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheelchair Rugby|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/IF_Sports/Wheelchair_Rugby/index.html|accessdate=2010-04-08}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main|Paralympic sports}}
There are twenty sports on the Summer Paralympic program and five sports on the Winter Paralympics program.  Within some of the sports are several events.  For example, [[Alpine skiing at the Winter Paralympics|alpine skiing]] has a slalom and giant slalom.  The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them.  Other international organizations, known as International Sports Federations (IF), notably the [[International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation]] (IWAS), the [[International Blind Sports Federation]] (IBSA), and the [[Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association]] (CP-ISRA), govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Organization/|accessdate=2010-04-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100421005622/http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Organization/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees, which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/|accessdate=2010-04-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100305234248/http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Cheating===
{{Main|Cheating at the Paralympic Games}}
After the [[2000 Summer Paralympics|2000 Sydney Games]], a [[Spain at the Paralympic Games|Spanish]] basketball player alleged that several members of the gold-medal winning Spanish basketball intellectually disabled (ID) team were not disabled.  He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve-member team met the qualifications of an intellectually disabled athlete.&lt;ref name=cheating2&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cheating shame of Paralympics|last=Slot|first=Owen|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2001-02-03|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2998162/Cheating-shame-of-Paralympics.html|accessdate=2010-04-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A controversy ensued and the IPC called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2000_11_27_a.html |title=IPC Calls For Full Investigation|accessdate=2010-04-07|date=2000-11-27|publisher=International Paralympic Committee |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060118062536/http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2000_11_27_a.html |archivedate = 2006-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had flouted the ID rules.  In an interview with the president of the federation that oversees ID competition, Fernando Martin Vicente admitted that athletes around the world were breaking the ID eligibility rules. The IPC responded by starting an investigation of its own.&lt;ref name=cheating2/&gt;  The results of the IPC's investigation confirmed the Spanish athlete's allegations and also determined that the incident was not isolated to the basketball ID event or to Spanish athletes.&lt;ref name=cheating2/&gt;  As a result all ID competitions were suspended indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2001_03_09_a.html |title=IPC Suspends INAS-FID from Membership|accessdate=2010-04-07|date=2001-03-09|publisher=International Paralympic Committee |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041224162629/http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2001_03_09_a.html |archivedate = 2004-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was lifted after the 2008 Games after work had been done to tighten the criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities.

The Paralympics have also been tainted by steroid use.  At the 2008 Games in Beijing, three powerlifters and a German basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances.&lt;ref name=cheating/&gt;  This was a decrease in comparison to the ten powerlifters and one track athlete who were banned from the 2000 Games.&lt;ref name=steroids&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympians can do the same thing as Olympic athletes-including cheating|publisher=CNNSI.com|work=Sports Illustrated|date=2002-03-06|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2002/03/06/paralympics_cheating_ap/|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids.

Another concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of &quot;[[boosting (doping)|boosting]]&quot;.  Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure, often by self-harming, which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15%.  This is most effective in the endurance sports such as [[Paralympic cross-country skiing|cross-country skiing]].  To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury.  This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly, and using high-pressured compression stockings.  The injury is painless but it does have an impact on the athlete's blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cheating probed at paralympic games|publisher=Canwest Publishing Inc.|work=The Ottawa Citizen|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|date=2010-03-18|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/2010wintergames/paralympics/cross-country-skiing/Cheating+Probed+Paralympic+Games/2697572/story.html|accessdate=2010-04-14}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential concern is the use of [[gene therapy]] among Paralympic athletes.  All Paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through [[gene doping]], but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary&quot;&gt;Wolbring, G.

The IPC have been working with the World Anti-Doping Agency since 2003, to ensure compliance with WADA's anti-doping code among its Paralympic athletes.&lt;ref name = &quot;PlayTrue&quot;&gt;World Anti-Doping Agency (2008).

The '''Olympic Pride House''' is a dedicated temporary location which plays host to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender athletes attending the Olympics or Paralympics in the host city. The first was organized for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.

===London 2012===
{{main|2012 Summer Olympics}}
An initial project for a Pride House at the 2012 Olympics would have taken place at [[Clapham Common]] for all 17 days of the event. On 24 April 2012 it was reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/topstories/9666422.Clapham_Common_house_loses_pride_of_place/?ref=nt]&lt;/ref&gt; that this project of the Pride House Foundation was cancelled due to lack of sponsors.

The following individuals were listed as ambassadors for Pride House:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ben-cohen.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=213&amp;Itemid=106]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Dan Savage]]
* [[John Amaechi]] OBE
* [[Claire Harvey]]
* [[Peter Tatchell]]
* [[Suran Dickson]]
* [[Richard Beaven]]
* [[Blake Skjellerup]]

On 12 July 2012, a new project for a Pride House at the 2012 Olympics was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/07/13/new-pride-house-launched-for-london-olympics/]&lt;/ref&gt; The event will take place from 3–7 August at CA House on Limehouse Basin, with activities continuing in other venues through 12 August, the day of closing ceremony. This new project will be managed by Pride Sports UK with support from the European Gay and Lesbian Sports Federation, the [[Federation of Gay Games]], GLISA International, the LGBT Consortium, and Pride House Foundation.

===Sochi 2014 attempt===
An attempt to obtain a Pride House at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi, Russia was struck down by the Ministry of Justice, which refused to approve the registration of the NGO set up to organize the Pride House. The ban was upheld by [[Krasnodar Krai]] Judge [[Svetlana Mordovina]] on the basis of the Pride House inciting &quot;propaganda of non-traditional sexual orientation which can undermine the security of the Russian society and the state, provoke social-religious hatred, which is the feature of the extremist character of the activity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/judge-bans-winter-olympics-gay-pride-house150312|title = Judge bans Winter Olympics gay Pride House|date = 15 March 2012|publisher = Gay Star News|author = Andy Harley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Games Lane of the London 2012 Olympic route network.JPG|thumb|A dedicated games lane on [[Cromwell Road]] as part of the Olympic route network during [[London 2012]].]]
The '''Olympic route network''' ('''ORN''') and the '''Paralympic route network''' ('''PRN''') is a network of dedicated roads linking venues and other key sites in the [[Host cities of the Olympic Games|host city]] during [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Paralympic games]] to ensure that athletes and officials get to events on time. Roads that are part of the network have 'games lanes' which are reserved for accredited games vehicles and on-call emergency vehicles.

For the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the route network came into effect under the [[London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006]] which gave the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] temporary powers to take over traffic management measures during [[London 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012 Olympic Route Network Q&amp;A |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18877516 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=17 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ORN and PRN were first introduced for the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]] as a result of problems at the [[Atlanta Olympics]] four years earlier when athletes had difficulty getting to their events on time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How will Games Lanes affect Olympics?n |author=Michael Hirst |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16441912 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, just before the start of the 2012 Olympics, [[Hackney carriage|London taxi drivers]] blocked some games lanes to protest against the ORN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012: Black cab drivers protest over Games Lanes ban |author=Michael Hirst |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16277688 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games lanes for London 2012 has been pejoratively referred to as [[ZiL lanes]], in reference to dedicated lanes for VIPs in Moscow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Zil lanes: From Moscow to London 2012|last=Sandford|first=Daniel|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18990105|publisher=BBC News|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Around the Rings''' (ATR) is a website covering the business and politics of the Olympic Movement, as well as a wide array of issues in international sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/feb/04/fifa-child-trafficking-sepp-blatter]&lt;/ref&gt;

ATR had its beginnings in the late 1980s when Atlanta was bidding for the 1996 Olympic Games. The company – originally known as Radio Atlanta – was founded in May 1992 by [[Ed Hula]]. The company’s global headquarters remains in Atlanta, with contributors and sales staff around the world. 

Over the years, ATR has become known as “the go-to source for Olympic bid information” and is frequently quoted across all international media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/search/content/living/stories/2008/07/18/rings_olympics_news.html Couple turns Olympics passion into online publication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gz2010.cn/10/0722/17/6C7BOHSN0078037F.html World press organisation helps to promote the Games]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/02/10/133655488/another-olympic-bidding-scandal Another Olympic Bidding Scandal?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/01/12/39459535.html Russians high on Olympic list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/09/25/commonwealth.games/?hpt=T1 Commonwealth Games chief: More needs to be done in India]&lt;/ref&gt; A subscription to the site is required in order to access premium content, although many articles and features are open to all visitors.  

Around the Rings delivers news across every distribution platform: print, online, email, and phone app.

==History==

Beginning in 1992, Ed Hula formed Radio Atlanta to provide radio networks in the U.S. with reporting about the [[1996 Olympics]]. Hula has provided coverage about every Olympics since Barcelona.

From 1994 to 1996, he was the Olympics correspondent for WGST, the official “information station” for the Atlanta Games.

From 1998 to 2001 he was based in Sydney as the Olympics editor for Radio 2UE, the rights-holding radio station for the [[2000 Olympic Games]].

Even in the mid-1990s, Hula was in the vanguard of new media, when he served as AOL’s Olympics reporter in Atlanta. 

While delivering his radio coverage to clients worldwide, Hula realized there was a need for specialized business news about the Olympics .

In the mid-1990s, he was asked to write a column for a weekly political newsletter that was mailed out across the Southeast. “The Hula Report”, as it was known, soon outgrew its one-page space allotment and became its own four- to eight-page fax distributed twice monthly. 
 
By 1998 electronic technology and delivery platforms were becoming increasingly important. ATR’s website, launched in late 1996, was already becoming a powerful point of delivery. As the fax expanded to 12 to 16 pages, it became necessary to convert the publication to an email format – and to open an office in Sydney, Australia, to cover the Games of 2000. Sydney was a watershed for Around the Rings. It also resulted in phenomenal growth for their readership as well as the range of their publications. 

The [[Nagano Olympics]] in 1998 were a milestone for Around the Rings and the Olympics when Ed Hula became the first New Media journalist accredited for the Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aroundtherings.com/public/EdHula_1st_Accredited_E-Pass.gif]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

During that time, Around the Rings developed an events arm with its Newsmaker Breakfast series. These networking events provide the opportunity for journalists, sports marketers and others with an interest in the Games to meet and talk in an informal setting.

Guests have included [[Jacques Rogge]], then president of the European Olympic Committees, [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]] of Athens 2004, [[Prince Albert of Monaco]], U. S. Olympic Committee presidents, [[Dmitry Chernyshenko]] of Sochi 2014, athletics great [[Sergey Bubka]], NBC Olympics chief [[Dick Ebersol]] and many other well-known figures in the Olympic Movement. 

Newsmaker Breakfasts have become a truly international event, having been hosted in Acapulco,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.sportsfeatures.com/presspoint/pressrelease/51695/the-youth-olympic-games-growth-spurt-growing-pains-around-the-rings-newsmaker-breakfast-acapulco The Youth Olympic Games: Growth Spurt &amp; Growing Pains - Around the Rings Newsmaker Breakfast Acapulco]&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlanta, Beijing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freenewspost.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=9976 Iraqi Discus Thrower Joins Olympic Medalists:Around the Rings Newsmaker Breakfast]&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, Copenhagen, London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=32578 ATR Newsmaker Breakfast: London Olympics Will Beat Bad Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; New York, Salt Lake City, Sydney, and Vancouver&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expertclick.com/NewsReleaseWire/IOC_EB_Member_BC_Finance_Minister_Join_Around_the_Rings_Newsmaker,201030679.aspx IOC EB Member, BC Finance Minister Join Around the Rings Newsmaker]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswiretoday.com/news/63859/ Sochi 2014 Leader Joins Around the Rings Newsmaker Breakfast 'Keeping the Games Alive']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the website celebrated its 20th anniversary cementing its claim &quot;20 years at #1.&quot;

==Expansion to Football==

In June 2009 Around the Rings created a second internet publication, [[World Football Insider]] (WFI). The company launched Insider after realizing the need for a reputable publication about the business of international football. Insider is the first online publication to focus on the business of football. Since its inception, correspondents have reported from Zurich, South Africa, Kuala Lumpur, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Nassau and many other locations to provide on-the scene reporting of major football events. It is a primary source of news about preparations for the FIFA World Cup and delivers information about [[FIFA]], its 208 member associations, the business of the six continental confederations, as well as the sponsors of the Beautiful Game.

==Publications==

ATR publishes high-impact magazines for major events on the Olympic calendar. These magazines are distributed at the events, typically at the conference site and in hotels and press centers.   

'''ATR Daily Editions''': The Daily Editions, published during the Olympic Games, target high level visitors and media with information directed at those in the host city.

The modern '''Olympic Games''' (French: ''Jeux olympiques''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.&quot;, [http://www.olympic.org/fr/].(..)&lt;/ref&gt;) are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes participate in a [[multi-sport event|variety of competitions]]. The Olympic Games are considered to be the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]] alternating, meaning they each occur every four years but two years apart. Their creation was inspired by the [[ancient Olympic Games]], which were held in [[Olympia, Greece]], from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] founded the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the [[Olympic Movement]], with the [[Olympic Charter]] defining its structure and authority.

The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Games for ice and winter sports, the [[Paralympic Games]] for athletes with a disability, and the [[Youth Olympic Games]] for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allow participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the [[Cold War]] limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.

The Olympic Movement consists of [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs), [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each celebration of the Games. The host city is responsible for organizing and funding the Games consistent with the Olympic Charter. The Olympic program, consisting of the [[Olympic sports|sports]] to be contested at the Games, is determined by the IOC. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the [[Olympic flag]] and [[Olympic Flame#Torches|torch]], as well as the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening and closing ceremonies]]. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third place finishers in each event receive [[Olympic medal]]s: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.

The Games have grown in scale to the point that nearly every nation is represented. Such growth has created numerous challenges, including [[Olympic Games scandals and controversies|boycotts]], [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games|doping]], [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bribery]], and [[Munich massacre|acts of terrorism]]. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national, and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

== Ancient Olympics ==

{{main|Ancient Olympic Games}}
[[File:Olympia-stadion.jpg|thumb|left|Stadium in [[Olympia, Greece]].]]

The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece]]. Competition was among representatives of several [[city-state]]s and kingdoms of [[Ancient Greece]]. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce.{{r|Swaddling 2000 p54}} This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Truce – Myth and Reality by Harvey Abrams|url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/abrams1.html|publisher=Classics Technology Center, AbleMedia.com|accessdate=12February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;{{sfn|Young|2004|p=12}} one of the most popular myths identifies [[Heracles]] and his father [[Zeus]] as the progenitors of the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;elis1-7-9&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|1992|p=227}}{{sfn|Young|2004|pp=12–13}} According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games &quot;Olympic&quot; and established the custom of holding them every four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;elis1-7-7&quot; /&gt; The myth continues that after Heracles completed his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labors]], he built the [[Olympic Stadium]] as an honor to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a &quot;[[stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]&quot; ({{lang-el|στάδιον}}, [[Latin]]: ''stadium'', &quot;stage&quot;), which later became a [[Stadion (unit of length)|unit of distance]]. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776&amp;nbsp;BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Games|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/59589/The-ancient-Olympic-Games|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|format=registration required|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, [[Discus throw|discus]] and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, [[pankration]], and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] events.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|pp=59–61}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Olympic Events|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/sports.html|publisher=Perseus Project of [[Tufts University]]|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition has it that [[Coroebus of Elis|Coroebus]], a cook from the city of [[Elis]], was the first Olympic champion.{{sfn|Golden|2009|p=24}}

The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus (whose [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|famous statue]] by [[Phidias]] stood in his temple at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]) and [[Pelops]], divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King [[Oenomaus]] of [[Pisa, Greece|Pisatis]].{{sfn|Burkert|1983|p=95}} The winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues.{{sfn|Swaddling|1999|pp=90–93}} The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an [[Olympiad]], was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the [[Panhellenic Games]], which included the [[Pythian Games]], the [[Nemean Games]], and the [[Isthmian Games]].&lt;ref&gt;Olympic Museum, &quot;The Olympic Games in Antiquity&quot;, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic Games reached their [[zenith]] in the 6th and 5th&amp;nbsp;centuries&amp;nbsp;BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393&amp;nbsp;AD, when the emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;However, Theodosius' decree contains no specific reference to Olympia {{harv|Crowther|2007|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another date commonly cited is 426&amp;nbsp;AD, when his successor, [[Theodosius II]], ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|p=54}}

== Modern Games ==

=== Forerunners ===
[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|upright|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]]]]

Various uses of the term &quot;Olympic&quot; to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century. The first such event was the [[Cotswold Games]] or &quot;Cotswold Olimpick Games&quot;, an annual meeting near [[Chipping Campden]], England, involving various sports. It was first organized by the lawyer [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]] between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day. The [[British Olympic Association]], in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, mentioned these games as &quot;the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings&quot;.&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'Olympiade de la République'', a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;frencholympics&quot; /&gt; The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the [[metric system]] into sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;frencholympics&quot; /&gt;

In 1850 an Olympian Class was started by Dr. [[William Penny Brookes]] at [[Much Wenlock]], in [[Shropshire]], England. In 1859, Dr. Brookes changed the name to the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games|Wenlock Olympian Games]]. This annual sports festival continues to this day.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=144}} The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Dr. Brookes on 15 November 1860.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=28}}

Between 1862 and 1867, [[Liverpool]] held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by [[John Hulley]] and [[Charles Melly]], these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' could compete.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=53–54}}{{sfn|Weiler|2004}} The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.{{r|Girginov Parry 2005 p38}} In 1865 Hulley, Dr. Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the [[British Olympic Association]]. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the [[Olympic Charter|International Olympic Charter]].{{sfn|Young|1996|p=24}} In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized at London's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml |title= Much Wenlock &amp; the Olympian Connection |publisher= Wenlock Olympian Society |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090123183803/http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate= 23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===

[[File:Stamp of Greece. 1896 Olympic Games. 2l.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A postage stamp from the first Greek Olympic stamp set.]]

Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor [[Panagiotis Soutsos]] in his poem &quot;Dialogue of the Dead&quot;, published in 1833.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=1}} [[Evangelos Zappas]], a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}} Zappas sponsored the first [[Zappas Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1859, which was held in an [[Athens]] city square. Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient [[Panathenaic Stadium]] so that it could host all future Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}}

The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=2, 13–23, 81}} Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=44}} In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] was inspired to found the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).&lt;ref name=&quot;wenlock&quot; /&gt; Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;wenlock&quot; /&gt; He presented these ideas during the first [[Olympic Congress]] of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the [[University of Paris]]. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games, to come under the auspices of the IOC, would take place in Athens in 1896.{{sfn|Coubertin|Philemon|Politis|Anninos|1897|p=8|loc=Part 2}} The IOC elected the Greek writer [[Demetrius Vikelas]] as its first president.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=100–105}}

=== 1896 Games ===

{{main|1896 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The opening ceremony in the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]].]]

The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/Athens-1896/ |title=Athens 1896 |publisher=The International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappas and his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]] had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=117}}&lt;ref&gt;Memoire sure le conflit entre la Grece et la Roumanie concernant l'affaire Zappa – Athens 1893, by F. Martens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'affaire Zappa – Paris 1894, by G. Streit&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Averoff]] contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=128}} The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=128}}

Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes and adaptations ===

{{main|Summer Olympic Games}}

After the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition in 1900]] and the [[World's fair]] at St. Louis in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] were side-shows. The Games at Paris did not have a stadium; but was notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the [[United States at the 1904 Summer Olympics|United States]]. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://proxy.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/history?year=1904 |title= St. Louis 1904 – Overview |publisher= ESPN |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Games rebounded when the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third [[Olympiad]]) were held in Athens. These Games are not officially recognized by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |title= 1906 Olympics mark 10th anniversary of the Olympic revival |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 28 May 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winter Games ====

{{main|Winter Olympic Games}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05472, St. Moritz, Winterolympiade.jpg|upright=0.93|thumb|left|An [[ice hockey]] game during the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] at [[St. Moritz]].]]

The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the [[list of IOC meetings|1921 Olympic Congress]], in [[Lausanne]], it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11&amp;nbsp;days) was held in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] in [[Chamonix]], France, in connection with the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] held three months later; this event became the first [[Winter Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chamonix&quot; /&gt; Although the same country was originally intended to host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm |title= Winter Olympics History |publisher= Utah Athletic Foundation |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was upheld until the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France; after that, beginning with the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Games]], the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.

==== Paralympics ====

{{main|Paralympic Games}}

In 1948, [[Ludwig Guttmann|Sir Ludwig Guttmann]], determined to promote the rehabitation of soldiers after [[World War II]], organized a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]]. Guttmann's event, known then as the [[IWAS World Games|Stoke Mandeville Games]], became an annual sports festival. Over the next twelve years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]], in Rome, Guttmann brought 400 athletes to compete in the &quot;Parallel Olympics&quot;, which became known as the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first Paralympics]]. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year. Since the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7582206.stm |title= History of the Paralympics |publisher= [[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2 February 2009 | date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement guaranteeing that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parahist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://oldwebsite.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Chairman of the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games|London organising committee]], [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]], said about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in London that,

==== Youth Games ====

{{main|Youth Olympic Games}}

In 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]] in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogge introduces&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Rice |first= John |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-07-05-2774646336_x.htm |title=IOC approves Youth Olympics; first set for 2010 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= USA Today |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|first Summer Youth Games]] were held in Singapore from 14–26 August 2010, while the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|inaugural Winter Games]] were hosted in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innsbruck is the host city for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games|publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|date=12 December 2008|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/61888/32574/1t8ch2t/innsbruck-is-the-host-city-for.html|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRIonYOG&quot; /&gt; The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;YOGisGo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;No kidding&quot; /&gt; The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2007-07-05-olympic-notes_N.htm |title= IOC votes to start Youth Olympics in 2010 |first= Vicky |last= Michaelis |date= 5 July 2007 |work= USA Today |accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent games ===

From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/london-2012-summer-olympics|title=London 2012|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, [[Vancouver]] hosted 2,566 athletes from 82 nations competing in 84 events during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.olympic.org/vancouver-2010-winter-olympics|title= Vancouver 2010 |publisher= International Olympic Committee |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the [[Olympic Village]]. This village is intended to be a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing to build convenient Olympic village|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262207.shtml|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees representing nations that did not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organizations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games. Examples of this include territories such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Bermuda]], and Hong Kong, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Charter|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723070003/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2009|page=61|format=PDF|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of the Charter allows for the establishment of new National Olympic Committees to represent nation which qualify as &quot;an independent State recognized by the international community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Charter|url=http://www.asksam.com/ebooks/releases.asp?doc_handle=135969&amp;file=Olympic-Charter.ask&amp;query=recognised%20by%20the%20international%20community&amp;search=yes|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it did not allow the formation of National Olympic Committees for [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Curaçao]] when they gained the same constitutional status as [[Aruba]] in 2010, although the IOC had recognized the [[Aruban Olympic Committee]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/executive-board-concludes-first-meeting-of-the-new-year/112731|date=13 January 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011|title=Executive Board concludes first meeting of the new year|publisher=olympic.org (&quot;Official website of the Olympic movement&quot;)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/mr-jose-perurena?articleid=133159|title=Curtain comes down on 123rd IOC Session|work=Olympic.org|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic and social impact on host cities and countries ===
Many economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such &quot;mega-events&quot; often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, A. K., &amp; Spiegel, M. M. (2011). The Olympic Effect*. ''The Economic Journal,'' 121(553), 652–677.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the [[Philanthropy#Modern vernacular uses of the word|philanthropic contributions of corporations]] headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. &quot;Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities.&quot; ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 58(1): 111–148.].&lt;/ref&gt; The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, M. A. (2008). &quot;Configuring the field of play: how hosting the Olympic Games impacts civic community.&quot; ''Journal of Management Studies'', 45(6), 1117–1146.&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Olympic Committee ==

{{main|International Olympic Committee}}
[[File:Siege cio.jpg|thumb|The I.O.C. headquarters at [[Lausanne]].]]

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations, recognized media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter.&lt;ref name=&quot;movement&quot; /&gt; As the umbrella organization of the Olympic Movement, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;movement roles&quot; /&gt;

The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:

* [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] (IFs) are the [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Federation of Association Football ([[FIFA]]) is the IF for Association football (soccer), and the [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]] is the international governing body for volleyball. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=For the Good of the Athletes|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|date=31 October 2007|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country. For example, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) is the NOC of the United States. There are currently 205 NOCs recognized by the IOC.&lt;ref name=&quot;iocfactsheet&quot; /&gt;
* Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organization of each Olympic Games. OCOGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/ioc-governance-organising-committees|title=Organising Committees for the Olympic Games |publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country.{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=53|loc=Rule 24}}

=== Criticism ===

The IOC has often been criticized for being an intractable organization, with several members on the committee for life. The presidential terms of [[Avery Brundage]] and [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] were especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement and the influence of advertising.{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=52–60}} He was accused of both racism, for his handling of the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] issue with the [[South Africa at the Olympics|South African]] delegation, and [[antisemitism]].{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=60–69}} Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both [[nepotism]] and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post|publisher=CBC Sports|date=18 May 2001|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaranch's ties with the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] in Spain were also a source of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympics:Barcelona Profile; Samaranch, Under the Gun Shoots Back|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=30 June 1992|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB173FF933A05755C0A964958260|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, it was uncovered that several IOC members had [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|taken bribes]] from members of the [[Salt Lake City]] bid committee for the hosting of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others. The scandal set off further reforms that changed the way host cities were selected, to avoid similar cases in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Drops Olympic Bid Case|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Abrahamson|first=Alan|date=6 December 2003|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/06/sports/sp-saltlakecity6|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[BBC]] documentary entitled ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: Buying the Games'', aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buying the Games&quot; /&gt; The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city.

The [[Turin]] [[Bids for the 2006 Winter Olympics|bid]] for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, [[Marc Hodler]], strongly connected with the rival bid of [[Sion, Switzerland]], alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|publisher=National Public Radio|date=7 February 2006|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, [[The Anti-Defamation League|The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)]] called the continued refusal by the International Olympic Committee to hold a moment of silence at the opening ceremony for the eleven Israeli athletes killed by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics, &quot;a continuing stubborn insensitivity and callousness to the memory of the murdered Israeli athletes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Committee's Refusal to Honor Munich 11 Mired in 'Stubborn Insensitivity and Callousness'|url=http://archive.adl.org/PresRele/TerrorismIntl_93/Olympic-Committee-Stubborn-Munich-11.htm|publisher=ADL|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercialization ==

{{main|Cost of the Olympic Games}}

The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors. It was not until the retirement of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]], in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Under the leadership of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt;

=== Budget ===

During the first half of the 20th century the [[IOC]] ran on a small budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organizing committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2&amp;nbsp;million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}}

The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] became a watershed moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organizing committee, led by [[Peter Ueberroth]], was able to generate a surplus of US$225&amp;nbsp;million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The organizing committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Program (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt; Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50&amp;nbsp;million for a four-year membership.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the [[Olympic rings|interlocking rings]], in their publications and advertisements.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}}

=== Effect of television ===

[[File:Olympic Final 2000 (1936 cartoon).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A cartoon from the 1936 Berlin Olympics imagines the year 2000 when spectators will have been replaced by television and radio, their cheers coming from loudspeakers.]]

The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin 1936|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822100804/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1956 Winter Olympics]] were the first internationally televised Olympic Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cortina d'Ampezzo|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1956|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822213008/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1956|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1960 Winter Olympics|following Winter Games]] had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialized television broadcasting networks—[[CBS]] paid US$394,000 for the American rights,{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) allocated US$660,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt; In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} For example, CBS paid US$375&amp;nbsp;million for the rights of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano Games]],{{sfn|Gershon|2000|p=17}} while [[NBC]] spent US$3.5&amp;nbsp;billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt;

Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of color television in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Whannel, G. (1984) The television spectacular in A. Tomlinson &amp; G. Whannel (Eds.), Five-ring circus (pp. 30–43). London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt; Global audience estimates for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Games]] was 600&amp;nbsp;million, whereas at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Games of 1984]], the audience numbers had increased to 900&amp;nbsp;million; that number swelled to 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion by the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2005|p=14}} However, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Games]] in Sydney, NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Series TV ratings slump|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/sports/main244877.shtml|work=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=4 May 2009 | date=27 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All fall down|last=Walters|first=Walters|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc.|date=2 October 2000|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110429222810/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archivedate=29 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratings&quot; /&gt; With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=16–18}} The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program. At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} Finally, the American television lobby was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=230}} The results of these efforts were mixed: ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2012 Summer Games became the most watched event in US television history.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratings&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Woods|2007|p=146}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Olympics 2012 Ratings: Most Watched Event In TV History|date=13 August 2012|publisher=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/london-olympics-2012-ratings-most-watched-ever_n_1774032.html|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===

The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial. The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialized sporting spectacle.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} The IOC indicated that they would address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=194–195}} Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2009/wp09-06bk.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, ''The Olympic Effect'', March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==

{{main|Olympic symbols}}
[[File:Olympic-flag-Victoria.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic flag]].]]

The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the [[Olympic rings]], consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Oceania, Europe). The colored version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colors were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympicsymbols&quot; /&gt;

The [[Olympic motto]], ''Citius, Altius, Fortius'', a [[Latin]] expression meaning &quot;Faster, Higher, Stronger&quot; was proposed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1894 and has been official since 1924.  The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Henri Didon]] OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sport athlétique&quot;, 14 mars 1891: &quot;[...] dans une éloquente allocution il a souhaité que ce drapeau les conduise ‘souvent à la victoire, à la lutte toujours’. Il a dit qu’il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d’être des sports athlétiques: citius, altius, fortius, ‘plus vite, plus haut, plus fort’.&quot;, cited in Hoffmane, Simone ''La carrière du père Didon, Dominicain. 1840 – 1900'', Doctoral thesis, Université de Paris IV – Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, ''Les fondements pédagogiques de la devise olympique „citius, altius, fortius“''&lt;/ref&gt;

Coubertin's Olympic ideals are expressed in the [[Olympic creed]]:

{{quote
| The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympicsymbols&quot; /&gt;
}}

Months before each Games, the [[Olympic Flame]] is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;torch&quot; /&gt; Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the torch relay was introduced at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Games]], as part of the German government's attempt to promote its [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympicsymbols&quot; /&gt;

The [[List of Olympic mascots|Olympic mascot]], an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. It has played an important part on the Games identity promotion since the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], when the Russian bear cub [[Misha]] reached international stardom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1279748/Londons-Olympic-2012-mascots-revealed-Wenlock-Mandeville-unveiled-faces-Games.html|title=London's Olympic 2012 mascots are revealed: Wenlock and Mandeville unveiled as the 'faces' of the Games|date=23 May 2010|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]].  Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Summer Games Mascots from Munich 1972 to London 2012|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|date=1 January 2013|url=http://www.olympic.org/assets/osc%20section/pdf/qr_3e.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremonies ==

{{main|Olympic Games ceremony}}

=== Opening ===

[[File:2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony (15).jpg|thumb|A scene from the opening ceremony of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London]]

As mandated by the [[Olympic Charter]], various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetW&quot; /&gt; Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCprotocol1&quot; /&gt; The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetW&quot; /&gt; The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCprotocol1&quot; /&gt; The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100&amp;nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |title= Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 8 August 2008 |accessdate=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], which was hosted in [[Athens|Athens, Greece]], the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetW&quot; /&gt;

=== Closing ===

[[File:Birdsclosing.jpg|thumb|left|Athletes gather in the stadium during the closing ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].]]

The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosingProtocol&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing Ceremony Factsheet|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=5 June 2012|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Closing_Ceremony_of_the_Games.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host country; the flag of Greece, to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosingProtocol&quot;/&gt; The president of the organizing committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Closing Ceremony |publisher= International Olympic Committee |date= 31 January 2002 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5gKmkOYeD |archivedate= 26 April 2009 |format= PDF |accessdate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/38344/32574/w6rlej/the-olympic-flags-and-emblem.html |title=The Olympic Flags and Emblem |publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosingProtocol&quot;/&gt;

== Sports ==

{{main|Olympic sports}}

The [[Olympic sports|Olympic Games program]] consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and nearly 400 events. For example, [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]]. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestling|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/wrestling/|accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sports&quot; /&gt; [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Athletics]], [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]], [[Fencing at the Summer Olympics|fencing]], and [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|artistic gymnastics]] are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program. [[Cross-country skiing at the Winter Olympics|Cross-country skiing]], [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|figure skating]], [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]], [[Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]], [[Ski jumping at the Winter Olympics|ski jumping]], and [[Speed skating at the Winter Olympics|speed skating]] have been featured at every Winter Olympics program since its inception in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. Current Olympic sports, like [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|badminton]], [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|basketball]], and [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|volleyball]], first appeared on the program as [[demonstration sport]]s, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp |title=Olympic Sports of the Past |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympic sports are governed by [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs) recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|pp=88–90}} There are sports recognized by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a program revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/index_uk.asp |title=International Sports Federations |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=87}} During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the program on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110429094118/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Factsheet: The sessions |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are recognized sports that have never been on an Olympic program in any capacity, including chess and surfing.&lt;ref name=&quot;recognizedsports&quot; /&gt;

In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic program and all non-Olympic recognized sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic program for each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic program.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; From this study five recognized sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic program.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] and [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Summer Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newosports&quot; /&gt;

The 114th [[List of IOC meetings|IOC Session]], in 2002, limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; Three years later, at the [[117th IOC Session]], the first major program revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|baseball]] and [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|softball]] from the official program of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Games]]. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 program featured just 26 sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.&lt;ref name=&quot;newosports&quot; /&gt;

=== Amateurism and professionalism ===

{{further|Amateur}}
[[File:Nagano 1998-Russia vs Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|left|Professional [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players were allowed to participate in [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]] starting in 1998 (''1998 Gold medal game between Russia and the Czech Republic pictured'').]]

The [[ethos]] of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[public school (United Kingdom)|English public school]] greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}} The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]'', a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}} Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}}

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/garmisch-partenkirchen-1936-winter-olympics |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123}} The advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot; of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses – from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comité International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amateurism&quot; /&gt; As of 2004, the only sport in which no professionals compete is [[boxing]], although even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment, as some boxers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees.

=== Boycotts ===

[[File:Olympic boycotts 1976 1980 1984.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Map showing the countries that boycotted the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] (yellow), [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] (blue) and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] (red) Summer Olympics.]]

Australia, France, Great Britain and Switzerland are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The [[Olympic Council of Ireland]] boycotted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Games]], because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the [[Irish Free State]] rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.{{r|Krüger Murray 2003 p230}} There were three boycotts of the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]]: Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland refused to attend because of the repression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] by the Soviet Union, but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the [[Suez Crisis]]; and China (the &quot;People's Republic of China&quot;) boycotted the Games because Taiwan was allowed to compete in the Games as the &quot;Republic of China&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boycott 1&quot; /&gt; In [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their [[racial segregation|segregationist]] regimes. New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because [[New Zealand national rugby union team|its national rugby union team]] had toured [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC boycott&quot; /&gt; Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC boycott&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore109/ore109h.pdf |title=Africa and the XXIst Olympiad |journal=Olympic Review |issue=109–110 |pages=584–585 |year=1976 |month=November–December |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan also decided to boycott these Games because the People's Republic of China (PRC) exerted pressure on the Montreal organizing committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name. The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the [[flag of the Republic of China|ROC flag]] and [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|anthem]] as long as the name was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore107/ore107i.pdf |title=Game playing in Montreal |work=Olympic Review |publisher=International Olympic Committee |pages=461–462 |issue=107–108 |year=1976 |month=October |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.&lt;ref name=&quot;corbit&quot; /&gt;

In 1980 and 1984, the [[Cold War]] opponents boycotted each other's Games. Sixty-five nations refused to compete at the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics in 1980]] because of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 81, the lowest number since 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/moscow-1980-summer-olympics |title=Moscow 1980|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and 15 other nations countered by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics of 1984]], contending that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes. Soviet officials defended their decision to withdraw from the Games by saying that &quot;chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria are being whipped up in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burns |first=John F. |title=Protests are Issue: Russians Charge 'Gross Flouting' of the Ideals of the Competition |work=The New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company |date=9 May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event, the [[Friendship Games]], in July and August.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980 Boycott&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1980 Boycott 2&quot; /&gt;

There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]], and in response to [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan disturbances]]. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australia: Calls to Boycott Beijing Olympics |work=Inter Press Service |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41699 Australia: Calls to Boycott Beijing Olympics |accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EUTibet&quot; /&gt; In August 2008, the government of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] called for a boycott of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], set to be held in [[Sochi]], Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110127092759/http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0711/p06s01-woeu.html Putin Faces Green Olympic Challenge: The Sochi 2014 Winter Games are threatened by a looming international boycott, environmental concerns, and public protests against local development], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.

=== Politics ===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G00630, Sommerolympiade, Siegerehrung Weitsprung.jpg|thumb|Jesse Owens on the podium after winning the long jump at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].]]

The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany wished to portray the [[Nazism|National Socialist Party]] as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]], though they used the Games to display [[Aryan]] superiority.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=107}} Germany was the most successful nation at the Games, which did much to support their allegations of [[Aryan]] supremacy, but notable victories by African American [[Jesse Owens]], who won four gold medals, and [[Hungary at the 1936 Summer Olympics|Hungarian]] Jew [[Ibolya Csák]], blunted the message.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|pp=111–112}} The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] did not participate until the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organized an international sports event called [[Spartakiad]]s. During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organizations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the &quot;bourgeois&quot; Olympics with the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|Workers Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSE&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Roche|2000|p=106}} It was not until the [[Soviet Union at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Games]] that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore84/ore84k.pdf |title=The USSR and Olympism |journal=[[Olympic Review]] |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |issue=84 |pages=530–557 |year=1974 |month=October |format=PDF |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], who finished first and third in the 200&amp;nbsp;meters, performed the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the victory stand. The second place finisher, [[Peter Norman]] of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for human rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] told the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Salute&quot; /&gt;

Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An Iranian [[judoka]], [[Arash Miresmaeili]], did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian Judoka rewarded after snubbing Israeli |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |date=8 September 2004|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5942871/ |accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of performance enhancing drugs ===

{{main|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games}}
[[File:Marathon Hicks1904.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]] running the [[marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]].]]

In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve and increase their athletic abilities. In 1904, Thomas Hicks-a gold medalist for the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. The Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines.&lt;ref name=&quot;wadahistory&quot; /&gt; By the mid-1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|work=Newsweek|date=7 January 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.{{sfn|Porterfield|2008|p=15}} The most publicized doping-related disqualification was in 1988 the Canadian Olympics where the Canadian sprinter, Ben Johnson (who won the 100-metre dash) was positive for [[stanozolol]]. His gold medal was later stripped and awarded to the American runner-up Carl Lewis, who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, by forming the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. Several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified because of doping offenses. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world attempt to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=27 April 2005|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances. Several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games; only three athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing.&lt;ref name=&quot;wadahistory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doping: 3667 athletes tested, IOC seeks action against Halkia's coach|date=19 August 2008|publisher=Express India Newspapers|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In London over 6,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes were tested.

=== Sex discrimination ===

{{main|Women at the Olympics}}
[[File:Charlotte Cooper.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Charlotte Cooper (tennis)|Charlotte Cooper]] of the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]], first woman Olympic champion, in the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Games]].]]

Women were first allowed to compete at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris, but at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] thirty-five countries were still fielding all-male delegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; This number dropped rapidly over the following years. In 2000, [[Bahrain at the Olympics|Bahrain]] sent two women competitors for the first time: [[Fatema Hameed Gerashi]] and [[Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al Hilli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/2000/09/23/anderson_arab_women/ &quot;Arab women make breakthrough at Games&quot;], CNN, 23 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Robina Muqimyar]] and [[Fariba Rezayee]] became the first women to compete for [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan at the Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3826673.stm &quot;Afghan women's Olympic dream&quot;], BBC, 22 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United Arab Emirates at the Olympics|United Arab Emirates]] sent female athletes ([[Maitha bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maitha Al Maktoum]] competed in taekwondo, and [[Latifa Al Maktoum]] in equestrian) to the Olympic Games for the first time. Both athletes were from [[Al Maktoum|Dubai's ruling family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Should Saudi Arabia be Banned from the Olympics? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-wallechinsky/should-saudi-arabia-be-ba_b_115736.html |publisher=''Huffington Post'' |date=29 July 2008 |first=David |last=Wallechinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games: [[Brunei at the Olympics|Brunei]], [[Saudi Arabia at the Olympics|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar at the Olympics|Qatar]]. Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would &quot;press&quot; these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. [[Anita DeFrantz]], chair of the IOC's Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] announced that it &quot;hoped to send up to four female athletes in [[Shooting at the 2012 Summer Olympics|shooting]] and [[Fencing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|fencing]]&quot; to the 2012 Summer Games in London.

In 2008, Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: &quot;For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organizations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination. [...] While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; In July 2010, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported: &quot;Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012. [...] Should Saudi Arabia [...] send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot; /&gt;

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] in [[London]], England, for the first time in Olympic history, every country competing included female athletes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudis to send 2 women to London, make history|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/07/12/saudi-arabia-women-london-olympics.ap/index.html|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one ([[Maziah Mahusin]], in the 400m hurdles). Qatar made one of its first female Olympians, [[Bahiya al-Hamad]] (shooting), its flagbearer at the 2012 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18813543 &quot;London 2012 Olympics: Saudi Arabian women to compete&quot;], BBC, 12 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the 2012 Olympics, runner [[Maryam Yusuf Jamal]] of [[Bahrain]] became the first Gulf female athlete to win a medal when she won a bronze for her showing in the 1,500m race.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/13/232068.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The only sport on the Olympic programme that features men and women competing together is the equestrian disciplines. There is no &quot;Women's Eventing&quot;, or 'Men's Dressage'. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the program in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], however, female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8196879.stm &quot;Women's boxing gains Olympic spot&quot;], British Broadcasting Corporation, 13 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently two Olympic events in which male athletes may not compete: [[synchronized swimming]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]].

=== Terrorism and violence ===

Three [[Olympiad]]s had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916 Games]] were cancelled because of [[World War I]], and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The [[2008 South Ossetia war|South Ossetia War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] erupted on the opening day of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. Both [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Vladimir Putin|Prime Minister Putin]] were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president [[Hu Jintao]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC 2009-01-30&quot; /&gt; When [[Nino Salukvadze]] of Georgia won the bronze medal in the [[Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics|10&amp;nbsp;meter air pistol]] competition, she stood on the medal podium with [[Natalia Paderina]], a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicized event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic Shooters Hug as their Countries do Battle|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/olympic.embrace/|accessdate=10 August 2008 | date=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] were held in [[Munich]], Germany, eleven members of the [[Israel at the Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] were taken hostage by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] terrorist group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] in what is now known as the [[Munich massacre]]. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and 5 terrorists also perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic archive|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1289-7332/sports/olympics_cbc/clip5|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism affected the last two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 1996]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb]] was detonated at the [[Centennial Olympic Park]], which killed two and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by [[Eric Rudolph]], an [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|American domestic terrorist]], who is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic Park Bombing|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], took place just five months after the [[September 11 attacks]], which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols of the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|day's event]]s. They included the flag that flew at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer [[Daniel Rodríguez]] singing &quot;[[God Bless America]]&quot;, and honor guards of NYPD and [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] members. The events of that day have made security at the Olympic Games an increasing concern for Olympic planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/05/03/ioc-bin-laden-killing-no-bearing-olympic-security|title=IOC on bin Laden killing: no bearing on Olympic security|date=3 May 2011|agency=Associated Press|work=Gazettenet.com|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Citizenship ==

=== IOC rules for citizenship ===

The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country they compete for. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed between when the competitor competed for his former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period.{{r|Olympic Charter 2011}} This waiting period exists only for those who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, they do not have to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.{{sfn|Shachar|2011|pp=2114–2116}}

=== Reasons for changing citizenship ===

Sometimes, athletes become citizens of new nations solely for the purpose of competing in the Olympics. This usually happens either because people are drawn to sponsorships and training facilities in places like the United States or because an athlete does not qualify in their original country. This is usually because there are many qualified athletes in an athlete’s home country and they want to be able to participate as well as help the team of their new country. Between 1992 and 2008, there were about fifty athletes that have emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

=== Citizenship changes and disputes ===

One of the most famous cases of changing nationality for the Olympics was [[Zola Budd]], a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom because there was an apartheid-era ban on the Olympics in South Africa. Budd was eligible for British citizenship because her grandfather was born there, but British citizens accused the government of expediting the citizenship process for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/feb/24/athletics.rorycarroll |title=What Zola Budd did next &amp;#124; Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= 24 February 2003|accessdate=27 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable examples include Kenyan runner [[Bernard Lagat]] who became a United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics even though he had already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, leaving his silver medal in jeopardy. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/3/3_1/lagat-a-runner-without-a-.shtml |title=Lagat a runner without a country |publisher=Cool Running |date= |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basketball player [[Becky Hammon]] was not being considered for the United States Olympic team but wanted to play in an Olympic Games, so she emigrated to Russia where she already played in a domestic league during the WNBA offseason. Hammon received criticism from some Americans, including the US national team coach, even being called unpatriotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3427182 |title=Olympics opportunity too much for Hammon to pass up – Olympics – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Champions and medalists ==

{{further|Lists of Olympic medalists|List of multiple Olympic gold medalists}}

The athletes or teams who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal however must contain at least six grams of pure gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeijingOlymp-1&quot; /&gt; The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a [[single-elimination tournament]] (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/st-louis-1904-summer-olympics|title=St Louis 1904|publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Modern Olympic Games|publisher=The Olympic Museum|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics as a measure of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Munro|first=James|title=Britain may aim for third in 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7579901.stm|accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of Olympic Games host cities}}

The host city for an Olympic Games is usually chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt; The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organization of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;hostcity&quot; /&gt; In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt; The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialized group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;hostcity&quot; /&gt;

Once the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analyzed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt; After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt;

By 2016, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries, but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92&amp;nbsp;years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in [[Rio de Janeiro]] will be the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded.

The United States has hosted eight Olympic Games, four Summer and four Winter, more than any other nation. The British capital London holds the distinction of hosting three Olympic Games, all Summer, more than any other city.  The other nations hosting the Summer Games twice are Germany, Australia, France and Greece. The other cities hosting the Summer Games twice are Los Angeles, Paris and Athens.

In addition to the United States, nations hosting multiple Winter Games are France with three, while Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Japan, Canada and Italy have hosted twice. Among host cities, [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[Innsbruck]] and [[St. Moritz]] have played host to the Winter Olympic Games more than once, each holding that honor twice. The most recent Winter Games were held in [[Vancouver]], Canada's third Olympics overall. The next Winter Games will be in [[Sochi]] in 2014, [[Russia]]'s first Winter Olympics and second Olympics overall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30456">[[File:2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony Olympic flag raising.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Olympic Flag being raised during the opening ceremony of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics by members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].]]
'''Olympic Games ceremonies''' were an integral part of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies harken back to the Ancient Games from which the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympics]] draw their ancestry.  An example of this is the prominence of Greece in both the opening and closing ceremonies.  During the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]], the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an [[olive wreath]].  The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter and cannot be changed by the host nation.  Even the artistic portion of the opening and closing ceremonies must meet the approval of the [[IOC|International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

The ceremonies have evolved over the centuries.   Ancient Games incorporated ceremonies to mark the beginning and ending of each successive game.  There are both similarities and differences between the ancient Olympic ceremonies and their modern counterparts.  While the presentation of the Games has evolved with improvements in technology and the desire of the host nations to showcase their own artistic expression, the basic events of each ceremony have remained unchanged.  The presentation of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies continue to increase in scope, scale and expense with each successive celebration of the Games, but they are still steeped in tradition.

== Ancient forerunners ==
The Ancient Games, held in Greece from ca. 776&amp;nbsp;BC to ca. 393&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient Olympic Games&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Ancient Olympic Games|publisher = The Olympic Movement|url = http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/Ancient-Olympic-Games/ |accessdate = 2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide the first examples of Olympic ceremonies.  The victory celebration, elements of which are in evidence in the modern-day medal and closing ceremonies, often involved elaborate feasts, drinking, singing, and the recitation of poetry.  The wealthier the victor the more extravagant the celebration.&lt;ref name=ancientgames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ancient Olympic Games|last=Swaddling|first=Judith|publisher=University of Texas Press|pages=90–93|year=1999|isbn=0-292-77751-5|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The victors were presented with an olive wreath or crown harvested from a special tree in Olympia by a boy, specially selected for this purpose, using a golden sickle.&lt;ref name=ancientgames/&gt;  The festival would conclude with the victors making solemn vows and performing ritual sacrifices to the various gods to which they were beholden.&lt;ref name=ancientgames/&gt;

There is evidence of dramatic changes in the format of the Ancient Games over the nearly 12 centuries that they were celebrated.  Eventually, by roughly the 77th Olympiad, a standard 18-event program was established.&lt;ref name=oprogram&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Ancient Olympic Games:A Reconstruction of the Program|last=Howell|first=Maxwell L.|publisher=San Diego State University|year=1975|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to open a Games in ancient Greece the organizers would hold an Inauguration Festival.  This was followed by a ceremony in which athletes took an oath of sportsmanship.  The first competition, an artistic competition of trumpeters and heralds, concluded the opening festivities.&lt;ref name=oprogram/&gt;

== Opening ==

[[File:2010 Opening Ceremony - Greece entering.jpg|thumb|200px|right|As per tradition, Greek athletes lead the Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics]]
[[File:2002 Winter Olympics flame.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The lighting of the cauldron during the opening ceremony of the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics]]
The Olympic opening ceremonies represent the official commencement of an Olympic Games.  In recent Olympics, athletic competition began prior to the opening ceremonies.  For example, the [[Association football|football]] competitions for both men and women at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] began two days prior (August 6) to the opening ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Complete Olympic Schedule |publisher=USA Today |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/beijing/results.htm |accessdate=2008-12-30 | date=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the Opening Ceremonies of a celebration of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetS&gt;{{cite web | title=Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games  |publisher=International Olympic Committee | date=June 2012|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Opening_ceremony_of_the_Games_of_the_Olympiad.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetW&gt;{{cite web  | title=Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee  |date = June 2012|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Opening_ceremony_of_the_Olympic_Winter_Games.pdf |format=PDF | accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these rituals were canonized at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Modern Olympic Games |chapter=The development of the Games – Between festival and tradition |publisher=International Olympic Committee|page=5|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_668.pdf |chapterurl=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_668.pdf#pages=5  |format=PDF |date=2009-09-12 | accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic program===
Coubertin's initial vision of the Modern Olympics featured both athletic competitions and artistic achievements.&lt;ref name=om&gt;{{cite book |title=Olympic Memoirs|first=Pierre|last=de Coubertin|publisher=International Olympic Committee|year=1997|isbn=92-9149-015-6|accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the modern Olympics have evolved into a celebration of sport, it is in the opening ceremonies that one can see the most of Coubertin's ideal. The ceremonies typically start with the raising of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetS/&gt;&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetW/&gt; The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture, history, and the current Olympic game motto.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol1/&gt; Since the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, the artistic presentations have continued to grow in scale and complexity. The opening ceremony at the Beijing Games, for example, reportedly cost US$100&amp;nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurring in the artistic portion of the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|date=2008-08-08|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parade of Nations===
The traditional part of the ceremonies starts with a &quot;Parade of Nations&quot;, during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, country by country. It is not compulsory for athletes to participate in the opening ceremonies.  Due to the short time interval between the ceremonies and the first events of the Games, many athletes competing in these early events elect not to participate. It is most common for swimmers to forgo the Opening Ceremony, due to their events being early on the first day of competition. 

Each country's delegation is led by a sign with the name of their country and by their nation's flag.&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetS/&gt;&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetW/&gt;  Traditionally (starting at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]), Greece enters first, due to its historical status as the progenitor of the Olympics, while the host nation marches last.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol1/&gt; In the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, the Greek flag led the parade, while the Greek team marched in last, as the host nation.

All other participating teams march after Greece and before the host nation, in order according to a language that the organizing committee for those games selects, which is usually the dominant language in the area of the host city. Announcers announce each country's name in English and French, as they both are the official languages of the Olympics, and the dominant language of the area of the host city, if neither English nor French are the dominant languages.

In the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] were official languages of the games, but due to the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in [[French language|French]] alphabetical order.  In the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 Summer Olympics]], teams were ordered by the number of strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker|first=Peter|title=Beijing Olympics open with spectacular ceremony|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-08-08|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china1 |accessdate=2009-01-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2010 Winter Olympics]], teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia.

===Traditional events===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II opens the 2012 London Olympic Games.webm|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opens the 2012 London Olympic Games]]After all nations have entered, the president of the Organizing Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president. At the end of his speech, he introduces the representative of the host country who officially declares the opening of the Games.  Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Olympic Charter presently requires the opener to be the host country's [[head of state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCprotocol2&quot; /&gt; However, there have been many cases where someone other than the host country's head of state opened the Games. The first example was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|Games of the II Olympiad]] in Paris in 1900, which had no opening ceremony. There are five examples from the United States alone in which the Games were not opened by the head of state.&lt;ref&gt;The first case was the [[1904 Summer Olympics|St. Louis Games]] at which David Francis, President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, performed the ceremony; nobody had thought of inviting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1932, the then-[[Governor of New York]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], opened the [[1932 Winter Olympics|III Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]]. Later that year the Vice President of the United States, [[Charles Curtis]], opened the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Games of the X Olympiad]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], stating, however, that he was doing so on behalf of President [[Herbert Hoover]]. In 1960, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] was sent by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to open the [[1960 Winter Olympics|VIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], California, and finally, in 1980, Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] stood in for President [[Jimmy Carter]] to open the [[1980 Winter Olympics|XIII Olympic Winter Games]], also in Lake Placid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic Charter provides&lt;ref name=&quot;OCprotocol2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|year=2011|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf|accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the person designated to open the Games should do so by reciting whichever of the following lines is appropriate:

* If at the Games of the [[Olympiad]] (Summer Olympics): ''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era''.

* If at the Winter Games: ''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of Winter Olympics] Olympic Winter Games''.

Before 1936, the opening official would often make a short welcoming speech before declaring the Games open. However, since 1936, when [[Adolf Hitler]] opened both the [[1936 Winter Olympics|Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics]] and the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Summer Olympics]], the openers have used the standard formula. Recent editions of the Winter Games have seen a trend of using the first version instead of the second, which happened in both the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Opening Ceremony: 2010 Winter Games declared open  |publisher=Vancouver 2010| date=12 February 2010|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/afp-news/opening-ceremony--2010-winter-games-declared-open_274384BS.html| accessdate=2010-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter Games. There have been four further exceptions to the rule:

* In 1976, [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Queen of Canada]], opened the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympics]] (first in French followed by the English) with:
&quot;I declare open the Olympic Games of 1976, celebrating the XXI Olympiad of the modern era.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=aKh9881Xc8A|title=Montreal 1976 Olympics Opening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1984, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] opened the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Summer Olympics]] with:
''Celebrating the XXIII Olympiad of the modern era, I declare open the Olympic Games of Los Angeles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=cbbVk3AGVhE|title=1984 LA Opening Ceremonies – Lighting of the Cauldron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2002, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] opened the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City]], which took place five months after the [[September 11 attacks]], with:
''On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation...,'' then the standard opening formula followed.

* In 2012, Elizabeth II, as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]], opened the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Summer Olympics]] with the same fashion in English, making it the second time that she opened the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Ub1XpUgrza0|title=Queen Elizabeth Opened London Olympic Games 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, the [[Olympic flag]] is carried horizontally (since the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]) into the stadium and hoisted as the [[Olympic Hymn]] is played. The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic flag must &quot;fly for the entire duration of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCprotocol2&quot;/&gt; At most games, the flag has been carried into the stadium by prominent athletes of the host nation, but in [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012]], it was carried by an international group of athletes and non-athletes famous for promoting Olympic values, including [[Muhammad Ali]] as a symbolic flag-bearer.

The flag bearers of all countries then circle a rostrum, where one athlete of the host nation (since the 1920 Summer Olympics), and one judge of the host nation (since the 1972 Summer Olympics) speak the [[Olympic Oath]], declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules of their respective sport.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol2/&gt;  Starting with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, and continuing with the tradition started at the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]] a coach from the host nation also speaks the [[Olympic Oath]].

===Olympic flame===
{{Further|Olympic flame|List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron}}
Finally, the [[Olympic Torch|Torch]] is brought into the [[Olympic Stadium|stadium]], passed from athlete to athlete during the [[torch relay]], until it reaches the last carrier; often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron.&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetS/&gt;&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetW/&gt; Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony for the 2010 Games]] in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was [[BC Place Stadium|BC Place]], which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist [[Catriona Le May Doan]], [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Nancy Greene]], who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Steve Nash]], a native of nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and hockey legend [[Wayne Gretzky]], to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm refused to light; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.

After the official conclusion of the Opening Ceremony, Gretzky was whisked away to a waiting car which took him to the secondary cauldron. Once there, he lit it to correspond with the tradition of Olympics past.

During the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the cauldron located inside [[Olympic Stadium (London)]] was not visible from outside of the stadium.  The image of the lit cauldron was projected on the stadiums rooftop screens during the first week of competition,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/cauldron-moved-into-position-olympic-stadium.html&lt;/ref&gt; and live footage was available to all broadcast right holders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london2012.com/media-centre/article=london-2012-olympic-cauldron-moved-into-position-ready-for-athletics-competition.html&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[List of 2012 Summer Olympics broadcasters]].

===Doves===
Beginning at the post–[[World War I]] 1920 Summer Olympics, the lighting of the Olympic Flame was followed by the release of [[dove]]s, symbolizing peace. This gesture was discontinued after several doves were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=doves&gt;{{cite web|title=When messengers of peace were burnt alive |publisher=Deccan Herald|date=2004-08-13 |url= http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/aug132004/oly5.asp   |accessdate=2009-01-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040829084509/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/aug132004/oly5.asp |archivedate = 2004-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetS/&gt;&lt;ref name=OCFactSheetW/&gt;

In the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2000 ceremony]], a dove image was projected on an enormous white cloth held by the athletes on the stadium floor. In [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2004]], an [[light-emitting diode|LED]] screen was used. In [[2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2006]], acrobats formed the shape of a dove. The [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 ceremony]] had fireworks representing doves. [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|In 2010]], dove figures were projected on the stage floor. The [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 ceremony]] had bicyclists with dove-wings, lit by LEDs.

==Medal presentation==
[[File:CyclingTeamPursuitBeijing2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The medal ceremony for the [[Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's team pursuit|men's team pursuit]] at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics]]
After each Olympic event is completed, a medal ceremony is held. The Summer Games would usually conduct the ceremonies immediately after the event at the respective venues, whereas the Winter editions would present the medals at a nightly victory ceremony held at a medal plaza. A three–tiered rostrum is used for the three medal winners, with the gold medal winner ascending to the highest platform. The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Games – the Medal Ceremonies|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC member is usually accompanied by a person from sports federation governing the sport (such as IAAF in athletics or FINA in swimming), who presents each athlete with a small bouquet of flowers.  When the Games were held in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the medal winners also received [[olive wreath]]s in honor of the tradition at the Ancient Olympics. After medals are distributed, the flags of the nations of the three medalists are raised. The flag of the gold medalist's country is in the center and raised the highest while the flag of the silver medalist's country is on the left facing the flags and the flag of the bronze medalist's country is on the right, both at lower elevations than the gold medalist's country's flag.  The flags are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medalist's country plays.&lt;ref name=otraditions&gt;{{cite news |title=Symbols and Traditions|publisher=USA Today|date=1999-07-12|url=http://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr03.htm|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies. They aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag bearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Medal Ceremony Hostess Outfits Revealed|publisher=China Daily|date=2008-07-18|url=http://english.sina.com/china/p/1/2008/0718/172118.html|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict rules govern the conduct of athletes during the medal ceremony.  For example they are required to wear only pre-approved outfits that are standard for the athlete's national Olympic team.  They are not allowed to display any political affiliation or make a political statement while on the medal stand.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol2/&gt; The most famous violation of this rule was the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] of [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].  For their actions, IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] demanded their expulsion from the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1968 Black Athletes make silent protest|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm|accessdate=2009-01-10 | date=1968-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) did not comply, then Brundage demanded the removal of the entire track and field team of the [[United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics|United States]].  The USOC complied with his demands and Smith and Carlos were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico 1968|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1968|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closing ==
[[File:Birdsclosing.jpg|thumb|200px|Athletes gather in the stadium during the closing ceremony of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics]]
[[File:2012 Olympic flame fading.jpg|thumb|200px|The Olympic Flame slowly going out during the London 2012 Summer Olympics]]
In contrast to the opening ceremonies, many elements of the Olympic closing ceremonies gradually developed more by tradition than official mandate.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing Ceremony Factsheet|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=2012-06-05|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Closing_Ceremony_of_the_Games.pdf|accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like the opening ceremonies, the closing ceremonies begins with the raising of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;/&gt; The traditional part of the closing ceremonies starts with the &quot;Parade of Flags&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;/&gt; where flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium in single file. Behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. This &quot;Parade of Athletes&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;/&gt; the blending of all the athletes, is a tradition that began during the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as &quot;one nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Melbourne (Equestrian – Stockholm) 1956|publisher=[[British Olympic Association]] |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=S&amp;ga=14 |accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]], the athletes marched in with their countrymen, then dispersed and mingled as the ceremonies went on.)

After all the athletes enter the stadium, the final medals ceremony of the Games is held. The organizing committee of the respective host city, after consulting with the IOC, determines which event will have its medals presented.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;/&gt; During the Summer Olympics, this is usually the men's marathon.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;/&gt; Traditionally, the men's marathon is held in the last hours of competition on the last day of the Olympics, and the race is won just before the start of the closing ceremony.  However, recent Summer Olympiads in [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]], and [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]] staged the marathon in the early morning due to heat problems in the host city. Since the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|2006 Winter Olympics]], the medals for the men's 50&amp;nbsp;km classical cross-country were presented at the closing ceremony.

Next, two other national flags are hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;/&gt; In  [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]],two Greeks flag was raised,because [[Greece]] was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004,because Greece is hosting the games. Then, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosing&quot;/&gt;

In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony (because the tradition began at the Antwerp Games), the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic Flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol2/&gt; The receiving mayor then waves the flag eight times. There are three such flags
* '''The Antwerp flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1920 Summer Olympics by the city of Antwerp, Belgium, and was passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Summer Olympics]] until the 1988 Games in Seoul.
* '''The Oslo flag''' was presented to the IOC at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] by the city of [[Oslo]], Norway, and is passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Winter Olympics]].
* '''The Seoul flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1988 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Seoul]], South Korea&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME TO USE 'REPUBLIC'--&gt; as a replacement for the Antwerp flag.

This tradition posed a particular challenge at the 2006 Winter Games in [[Turin]], Italy. The flag was passed from [[Sergio Chiamparino]], the mayor of Turin, to [[Sam Sullivan]], the mayor of [[Vancouver]], Canada.  Mayor Sullivan, who is a [[quadriplegic]], waved the flag by holding it in one hand and swinging his motorized wheelchair back and forth eight times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vancouver Mayor Achieves his Dreams with a Big Heart and Mechanical Help|publisher=Disabled World|last=Thomas|first=Andrew|date=2008-04-18|url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/sam-sullivan.shtml|accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}
The '''Olympic Charter''', last updated 8 July 2011, is a set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the [[Olympic Games]], and for governing the Olympic movement. Adopted by [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), it is the codification of the fundamental principles, rules and by-laws.  French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Charter.  If, at any time, there is a discrepancy between versions of the text, the French text prevails.

==Purpose==
Throughout the history of the Olympics, the Olympic Charter has often decided the outcome of Olympic controversy. As expressed in its introduction, the Olympic Charter serves 3 main purposes:
*to establish principles and values of Olympism
*to serve as IOC law
*to define the rights and obligations of the 4 main constituents of the Olympic movement: the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), the [[International Federations]] and the [[National Olympic Committee]]s, and the [[Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games]].

==Main components==
With its 5 chapters and 61 articles, the Olympic Charter outlines in detail several guidelines and rules.  This article highlights and summarizes those items considered most important to governing the Olympic Games, the Olympic movement, and its 3 main constituents: the International Olympic Committee, the International Federations, and the National Olympic Committees.

===Chapter 1: The Olympic Movement and its Action===
'''Article 2:''' The mission of the IOC is to promote Olympism throughout the world
and to lead the Olympic Movement.  This includes upholding ethics in sports, encouraging participation in sports, ensuring the Olympic Games take place on a regular period, protecting the Olympic Movement, and encouraging and supporting the development of sport.

'''Article 6:''' The Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in individual or team events and not between countries.

'''Article 8:''' The Olympic symbol consists of five interlocking rings which, from left to right are blue, yellow, black, green and red.

===Chapter 3: The International Federations (IFs)===
Chapter 3 discusses the role of [[International Federations]] (IFs) in the Olympic movement.  IFs are international non-governmental organizations that administer to sports at the world level and encompass organizations administering such sports at the national level.  For each sport that is part of the Olympic Games, an International Federation exists.  These IFs work to ensure their sports are developed in a way that agrees with the Olympic Charter and the Olympic spirit.  With technical expertise in its particular sport, an IF has control over eligibility for competition as well as details of the venue in which the athletic competition takes place.

===Chapter 4: The National Olympic Committees (NOCs)===
'''Article 28:''' The mission of the [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) is to develop, promote and protect the Olympic Movement in their respective countries.  The role of NOCs within each country is to promote the spirit of Olympicism, ensure the observance of the Olympic Charter, and to encourage ethics in and development of sports.  They are in charge of their country's representation at the Games, deciding on a host city for the Games, and cooperation with governmental and non-governmental bodies during the Games.

===Chapter 5: The Olympic Games===
This chapter addresses the celebration of the Olympic Games, the selection of the host city, the eligibility code for participation in the games, those sports included in the Games, media coverage, publications, and propaganda allowed for the Games.

In addition, Section 3 of this chapter discusses applicable protocol for Olympic functions and events.  This includes an outline of use of the Olympic flag, flame, and opening and closing ceremonies.

==In the media==
The Olympic Charter is not simply a matter of unenforced policy for the Olympic Games.  Throughout history, it has served as guidance for the proceedings of the Games.  Below are a few of the most recent examples:

*2012: The Lebanese judo team at the 2012 London Olympics refused to practice next to the Israeli one, and a makeshift barrier was erected to split their gym into two halves. The two teams were scheduled to use the same gym and mats at London’s new ExCeL center for their final preparations. However, the delegation from Lebanon would not train in view of the Israeli team, and insisted some sort of barrier be placed between them. Organizers accepted the Lebanese coach’s demand to separate the teams, erecting a barrier so that the Lebanese team wouldn’t see the Israeli one.

* 2011 / 2012: [[Human Rights Watch]] accused [[Saudi Arabia]] of contravening the Olympic Charter by systematically preventing women from practicing sports in the country, and by not allowing Saudi women athletes to take part in the Olympic Games, thus violating the fourth, sixth and seventh fundamental principles of the Charter, which every member of the Olympic Movement is bound to. This came as [[Anita DeFrantz]], chair of the I.O.C.'s Women and Sports Commission, suggested that the country be barred from participating in the Olympics until it agrees to send women athletes to the Games. I.O.C. spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau, however, indicated that the Committee &quot;would not mandate that the Saudis have female [[Saudi Arabia at the 2012 Summer Olympics|representation in London]]&quot;, arguing that &quot;the I.O.C. does not give ultimatums nor deadlines but rather believes that a lot can be achieved through dialogue&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/sports/olympics/olympic-ban-on-saudi-arabia-is-urged-over-lack-of-female-athletes.html &quot;Ban Urged on Saudi Arabia Over Discrimination&quot;], ''New York Times'', 15 February 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidethegames.biz/summer-olympics/2012/9939-qatar-set-to-bow-to-ioc-pressure-and-send-women-to-london-2012 &quot;Qatar decision to send female athletes to London 2012 increases pressure on Saudi Arabia&quot;], Inside the Games, 1 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/sport/other-sport/hurdles-the-biggest-olympic-barrier-for-saudi-women &quot;Hurdles the biggest Olympic barrier for Saudi women&quot;], Associated Press, 18 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* August 2007: Edward McMillan-Scott, Vice President of the European Parliament, called for a debate on whether athletes should boycott the Beijing Olympics in response to human rights abuses. The continuing evidence of persecution and human rights abuses in China cannot be reconciled with the Olympic Spirit set out in Article 1 of the Olympic Charter which seeks &quot;respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.&quot;

* 2 November 2005: Active lobbying against Lord Moynihan in the election of the British Olympic Association (BOA) chairman.  The Olympic Charter calls for no government interference in Olympic Association elections.  Therefore, the issue is being investigated and if the Sports Minister did mislead Parliament, a resignation will most likely ensue.

* May 2004: [[Bernard Lagat]] became a US citizen 3 months before he ran track in Athens and won the silver medal in 2004.  The glitch is that he won the medal for Kenya, which does not allow dual citizenship, and the Olympic Charter requires each athlete to be a citizen of the country he or she competes for.  Lagat was permitted to retain his medal, but had to wait until 2007 before being eligible to compete in any other international athletics events.

* December 2004: It was discovered that [[Marion Jones]], 5-time medalist of Track &amp; Field at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, may have been on several banned steroids and hormones when she competed.  Because the Olympic Charter states that no decision taken at the Olympic Games can be challenged after a period of 3 years after the closing ceremony, Jones could not lose these medals involuntarily except for doping violations. Jones was later stripped of every Olympic medal dating back to September 2000 after admitting that she took performance-enhancing drugs.

== Protection of Olympism as a belief ==

There has been a suggestion from lawyers that, in the UK, those with a strong belief in Olympism could benefit from protection against discrimination in exactly the same way that followers of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] or any other religion are protected.{{fact|date=August 2013}}

An '''Olympic diploma''' is a paper certificate awarded to the top eight finishers in competitions at the [[Olympic Games]]. While the top three finishers have received [[Olympic medal|medals]] since the 1896 Olympics, from 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as Olympic diplomas; in 1984 diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added.

'''Daniel Kent Neil Johnson''' is a [[Canadian American]] [[microeconomist]] and [[entrepreneur]]. He is currently [[Professor#Canada and the United States|associate professor]] and [[Chair (academic)#Named professorships|chair]] of the [[economics]] department at [[Colorado College]]. His most notable research has been in predicting [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/19/olympic-medal-predictions-business-sports-medals.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Johnson's Olympic Medals Model uses five variables: country's [[per-capita income]], [[population]], [[political structure]], [[climate]], and host-nation advantage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2010/03/americas_joy_austrias_sorrow.html&lt;/ref&gt; The model does not take into account athletic abilities of any star Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coloradocollege.edu/newsevents/newsroom/dan-johnson-the-man-who-predicts-medals&lt;/ref&gt; It has demonstrated 94% accuracy for predicting national medal counts and 87% accuracy for gold medal counts.&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444184704577585541737428800.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, Johnson's model has become increasingly more accurate at predicting the number of gold medals a country will win, while becoming marginally less accurate at predicting the total number of medals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/21559674&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's other work is in [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] [[analysis]], with emphasis on [[business development]]. He has worked in the areas of [[commodity]] [[analysis]], [[technology]] growth, and [[innovation]], among others.

== Entrepreneurship ==
In 2012, Johnson formed ''BookCheetah'', an online textbook trading service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coloradoconnection.com/news/story.aspx?id=797492#.ULqWK9PjlN0&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olympic Games'''  ({{lang-grc|τὰ Ὀλύμπια ; ''ta Olympia''; the Olympics}}) were a series of [[Athletics (sport)|athletic competition]]s among representatives of [[polis|city-state]]s of [[Ancient Greece]]. They were held in honor of [[Zeus]], and the Greeks gave them a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] [[aition|origin]]. Historical records indicate that they began in 776&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]], until the emperor [[Theodosius I]] suppressed them in 394&amp;nbsp;AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of Rome]]. The games were usually held every four years, or ''[[olympiad]]'', which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. Basing on this, it gives about 292 Olympic Games and compared to it modern knowledge
about this events is little (for example  known 1029 victories constitute less than 22% of projected 4760). &lt;ref&gt;http://ancientolympicgames.org/athletes/how-do-we-know/&lt;/ref&gt;
During the celebration of the games, an [[Olympic Truce]] was enacted so that athletes could travel from their countries to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were wreaths of laurel leaves. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations and artistic competitions. The [[statue of Zeus at Olympia]] was counted as one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]]. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.

The ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate,&lt;ref&gt;David Sansone, ''Ancient Greek civilization'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; although a woman [[Bilistiche]] is also mentioned as a winning chariot owner. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any [[List of ancient Greek cities|city-state]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] were allowed to participate, although the [[Hellanodikai]], the officials in charge, allowed king [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]] to participate in the games only after he had to prove his Greek ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Malcolm Errington, ''A history of Macedonia'', University of California Press, 1990, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Roisman, Ian Worthington, ''A Companion to Ancient Macedonia'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The games were always held at Olympia rather than alternating to different locations as is the tradition with the modern [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=perseus&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ancient Olympics|publisher=Tufts University|work=The Perseus Project|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics|accessdate=2010-02-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100210170341/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics| archivedate= 10 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.

==Origins==
[[File:Olympos.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's impression of ancient Olympia]]
To the Greeks it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, pp.101–102&lt;/ref&gt; These origin of traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest myths regarding the origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. According to the story, the [[Dactyl (mythology)|dactyl]] Herakles (not to be confused with the son of [[Zeus]]) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath, (which thus became a peace symbol) which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively).&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, pp.225–226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Description of Greece, 5.7.6-9&lt;/ref&gt; The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus), would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth, this one occurring after the aforementioned myth, is attributed to [[Pindar]]. He claims the festival at Olympia involved [[Pelops]], king of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and eponymous hero of the [[Peloponnesus]], and Herakles, the son of Zeus. The story goes that after completing his [[12 Labors|labors]], Herakles established an athletic festival to honor his father. Pelops, using trickery, and the help of [[Poseidon]], won a chariot race against a local king and claimed the king's daughter. This is also attributed to Pausanias and is dated by the historian at 776&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, pp.229–232&lt;/ref&gt; The games of previous millennia were discontinued and then revived by [[Lycurgus of Sparta]], [[Iphitos of Elis]], and Cleoisthenes of [[Pisa, Greece|Pisa]] at the behest of the [[Oracle of Delphi]] who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, pp.102–103&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, p.102–104&lt;/ref&gt; Since these myths were documented by historians like Pausanias, who lived during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the 160s&amp;nbsp;AD, it is likely that these stories are more fable than fact.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, pp.231–232&lt;/ref&gt; 

The origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] of the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean]] period and later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy J. Raschke|title=Archaeology Of The Olympics: The Olympics &amp; Other Festivals In Antiquity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DwU1IlTEhrYC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=12 August 2012|date=15 June 1988|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-11334-6|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples are known such as those held for [[Patroclus]] by [[Achilles]], described by [[Homer]] and in Book 5 of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', in which [[Aeneas]] organizes athletic contests on the anniversary of his father's death.

== History ==
The games were held to be one of the two central rituals in [[Ancient Greece]], the other being the much older religious festival, the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HickokSports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/olancien.shtml |title=The Ancient Olympic Games |publisher=HickokSports |date=2005-02-04 |accessdate=2007-05-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070510082340/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/olancien.shtml| archivedate= 10 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I see the citation.....but still, something is missing here --&gt;

The games started in Olympia, Greece, in a sanctuary site for the [[List of deities|Greek deities]] near the towns of Elis and [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisa]] (both in [[Elis]] on the peninsula of [[Peloponnesos]]). The first games began as an annual foot race of young women in competition for the position of the priestess for the goddess, [[Hera]]&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias: v. 16. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and a second race was instituted for a consort for the priestess who would participate in the religious traditions at the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar: Pythian Odes ix&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heraea Games]], the first recorded competition for women in the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's ''[[Description of Greece]]'', c. AD&amp;nbsp;175, state that [[Alcathous|Hippodameia]] gathered a group known as the &quot;Sixteen Women&quot; and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to [[Pelops]]. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the &quot;[[Sixteen Women]]&quot; were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[mythology]], Zeus was the father of the deities in the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of that era. The Sanctuary of [[Zeus]] in Olympia housed a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue in ivory and gold of Zeus]] that had been sculpted by [[Phidias]] circa 445&amp;nbsp;BC. This statue was one of the ancient [[Seven Wonders of the World]]. By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants. 

The historian [[Ephorus]], who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Numa Pompilius 1.4''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, ''1.74-1-3''. Little remains of Eratosthenes' ''Chronographiae'', but its academic influence is clearly demonstrated here in the ''Roman Antiquities'' by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denis Feeney in ''Caesar's Calendar: Ancient Time and the Beginnings of History''. (Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 2007), 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term ''[[Olympiad]]'' for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316&amp;nbsp;BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765&amp;nbsp;BC for the first year of the first Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Athletics of the Ancient Olympics: A Summary and Research Tool&quot; by Kotynski, p.3 (Quote used with permission). For the calculation of the date, see Kotynski footnote 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Alfred Mallwitz's article &quot;Cult and Competition Locations at Olympia&quot; p.101 in which he argues that the games may not have started until about 704 BC. Hugh Lee, on the other hand, in his article &quot;The 'First' Olympic Games of 776 B.C.E&quot; p.112, follows an ancient source that claims that there were twenty-seven Olympiads before the first one was recorded in 776. There are no records of Olympic victors extant from earlier than the fifth century BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StoneSeats.JPG|right|thumb|The &quot;Exedra&quot; reserved for the judges at Olympia on the north embankment of the stadium]]
The only competition held then was, according to the later Greek traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] who wrote in 175&amp;nbsp;AD., the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' race, a race over about {{convert|190|m}}, measured after the feet of Hercules. The word ''stadium'' is derived from this foot race. 

The Greek tradition of [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|athletic nudity]] was introduced in 720&amp;nbsp;BC, either by the Spartans or by the Megarian [[Orsippus]], and this was adopted early in the Olympics as well.

Several groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668&amp;nbsp;BC, Pheidon of [[Argos]] was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.

The Olympic Games were part of the [[Panhellenic Games]], four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The Olympic Games were more important and more prestigious than the [[Pythian Games|Pythian]], [[Nemean Games|Nemean]], and [[Isthmian Games]].

The games were in decline for many years but continued past 385 AD, by which time flooding and earth quakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David C.

== Culture ==
[[File:Discobolus Lancelotti Massimo.jpg|right|thumb|The &quot;Discobolus&quot; is a copy of a Greek statue c. 5th century BC. It represents an ancient Olympic discus thrower]]
The ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god [[Zeus]], and on the middle day of the games, 100 oxen would be sacrificed to him.&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt; Over time Olympia, site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and a temple, built by the Greek architect [[Libon (architect)|Libon]] was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest [[Doric order|Doric]] temples in Greece.&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt; The sculptor [[Pheidias]] created a statue of the god made of gold and ivory. It stood {{convert|42|ft}} tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]].&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt; As the historian [[Strabo]] put it, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;... the glory of the temple persisted&amp;nbsp;... on account both of the festal assembly and of the Olympian Games, in which the prize was a crown and which were regarded as sacred, the greatest games in the world. The temple was adorned by its numerous offerings, which were dedicated there from all parts of Greece.&quot;&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Artistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Sculptors created works like [[Myron]]'s ''[[Diskobolos]]'' or ''Discus Thrower''. Their aim was to highlight natural human movement and the shape of muscles and the body. Poets would be commissioned to write prose in honor of the Olympic victors. These poems, known as ''Epinicians'', were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose.&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt; [[Baron Pierre de Coubertin]], one of the founders of the modern [[Olympic Games]], wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was to feature an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, 2000, pp.3–4&lt;/ref&gt;  His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in [[Athens]] in [[Olympic Games|1896]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:GR-acropolis-parthenon.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], one of the leading city-states of the ancient world]]
Power in [[ancient Greece]] became centered around the [[city-state]] in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, pp.9–10&lt;/ref&gt; These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: On one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Raschke, 1988, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to the mountain competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' rolls.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, p.172&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] was founded c. 630&amp;nbsp;BC by settlers from [[Santorini|Thera]] with [[Sparta]]n support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, [[Greek people|Hellenistic]] culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, pp.182–183&lt;/ref&gt; 

The games faced a serious challenge during the [[Peloponnesian War]], which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenistic city-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peloponnesian War|last=Lendering|first=Jona|publisher=Livius, Articles on Ancient History|url=http://www.livius.org/pb-pem/peloponnesian_war/peloponnesian_war.html|accessdate=2010-02-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100213095957/http://www.livius.org/pb-pem/peloponnesian_war/peloponnesian_war.html| archivedate= 13 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt;&lt;ref name=thucydides&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Peloponnesian War|last=Thucydides|date=431&amp;nbsp;BC|volume=5|publisher=The Internet Classics Archive|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.5.fifth.html|accessdate=2010-02-13|others=Translated by [[Richard Crawley]]|isbn=0-525-26035-8| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100213061123/http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.5.fifth.html| archivedate= 13 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Olympic Games, a truce, or ''ekecheiria'' was observed. Three runners, known as ''spondophoroi'' were sent from [[Elis]] to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce.&lt;ref name=swaddling11&gt;Swaddling, 1999, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia, wars were suspended, and legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed.&lt;ref name=swaddling11/&gt; [[Thucydides]] wrote of a situation when the [[Sparta]]ns were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 [[mina (unit)|minae]] for assaulting the city of [[Lepreum]] during the period of the ''ekecheiria''. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.&lt;ref name=thucydides/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strassler &amp; Hanson, 1996, pp.332–333&lt;/ref&gt;

While a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 2007, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Sotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this act he was banished by the Cretans.&quot;&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Events ==
[[File:Hoplitodromos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1471.jpg|thumb|Athletes running the [[hoplitodromos]]]]
Only free men who spoke [[Greek language|Greek]] were allowed to participate in the Ancient Games of classical times.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} They were to some extent &quot;international&quot;, in the sense that they included athletes from the various Greek city-states. Additionally, participants eventually came from Greek colonies as well, extending the range of the games to far shores of the [[Mediterranean]] and of the [[Black Sea]].

To be in the games, the athletes had to qualify and have their names written in the lists. It seems that only young people were allowed to participate, as the Greek writer [[Plutarch]] relates that one young man was rejected for seeming overmature, and only after his lover, who presumably vouched for his youth, interceded with the King of Sparta, was he permitted to participate. Before being able to participate, every participant had to take an oath in front of the statue of [[Zeus]], saying that he had been in training for ten months.

At first, the Olympic Games lasted only one day, but eventually grew to five days. The Olympic Games originally contained one event: the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' (or &quot;stade&quot;) race, a short sprint measuring between {{convert|180|and|240|m}}, or the length of the stadium. The length of the race is uncertain, since tracks found at archeological sites, as well as literary evidence, provide conflicting measurements. Runners had to pass five stakes that divided the lanes: one stake at the start, another at the finish, and three stakes in between. 

[[File:Ancient Olympic Starting Line.JPG|thumb|A section of the stone starting line at Olympia, which has a groove for each foot]]

The ''[[diaulos (running race)|diaulos]]'', or two-stade race, was introduced in 724&amp;nbsp;BC, during the 14th Olympic games. The race was a single lap of the stadium, approximately {{convert|400|m}}, and scholars debate whether or not the runners had individual &quot;turning&quot; posts for the return leg of the race, or whether all the runners approached a common post, turned, and then raced back to the starting line. 

A third foot race, the ''dolichos'', was introduced in 720&amp;nbsp;BC. Accounts of the race present conflicting evidence as to the length of the ''dolichos''; however, the length of the race was 18–24 laps, or about three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km). The runners would begin and end their event in the stadium proper, but the race course would wind its way through the Olympic grounds. The course often would flank important shrines and statues in the sanctuary, passing by the [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] statue by the temple of [[Zeus]] before returning to the stadium. 

The last running event added to the Olympic program was the ''[[hoplitodromos]]'', or &quot;Hoplite race&quot;, introduced in 520&amp;nbsp;BC and traditionally run as the last race of the Olympic Games. The runners would run either a single or double ''[[diaulos (running race)|diaulos]]'' (approximately 400 or 800 yards) in full or partial armour, carrying a shield and additionally equipped either with [[greave]]s or a helmet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilman1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Athletics and Mathematics in Archaic Corinth: The Origins of the Greek Stadion|last=Gilman|first=David|year=1993|isbn=0-87169-206-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HiILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT53|publisher=American Philosophical Society|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrottet1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrottet|first=Tony|title=Let the Games Begin|journal=Smithsonian Magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2004/august/games.php?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the armour weighed between 50 and {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}}, the ''hoplitodromos'' emulated the speed and stamina needed for warfare. Due to the weight of the armour, it was easy for runners to drop their shields or trip over fallen competitors. In a vase painting depicting the event, some runners are shown leaping over fallen shields.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The course they used for these runs were made out of clay, with sand over the clay.

Over the years, more events were added: [[Ancient Greek boxing|boxing]] (''pygme''/''pygmachia''), [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] (''pale'') in 708 BC,&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=dHvoM08EYccC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=greek+wrestling+olympic+bc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ya4aUdS_HciLywH6ooD4Cg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=greek%20wrestling%20olympic%20bc&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pankration]], a fighting competition combining both elements. Wrestling was also the final decisive event in the ancient pentathlon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympics.mu/ancient-olympic-wrestling.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acta-archeo.com/html/4-11793-Pancrace.php&lt;/ref&gt; Boxing became increasingly brutal over the centuries. Initially, soft leather covered their fingers, but eventually, hard leather with metal sometimes was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576089/Ancient_Olympic_Games.html|title=Boxing gets Brutal |publisher=Encarta|date=2006-03-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKLElKO|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fights had no rest periods and no rules against hitting a man while he was down. Bouts continued until one man either surrendered or died- however, killing an opponent wasn't a good thing, as the dead boxer was automatically declared the winner.

Other events include [[chariot racing]], as well as a [[pentathlon]], consisting of wrestling, ''stadion'', [[long jump]], [[javelin throw]], and [[discus throw]] (the latter three were not separate events). In the chariot racing event, it was not the rider, but the owner of the chariot and team who was considered to be the competitor, so one owner could win more than one of the top spots. 

[[File:Bruttium-Rhegion-coin-478-476-BC.jpg|thumb|310px|In 484 or 480 BC, [[Anaxilas]], [[tyrant]] of [[Rhegium]], won the mule ''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]'' event, and this [[tetradrachm]] was struck in commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/bruttium.html Brutium],&quot; in Barclay Vincent Head, ''Historia Numorum''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The addition of events meant the festival grew from one day to five days, three of which were used for competition. The other two days were dedicated to religious rituals. On the final day, there was a banquet for all the participants, consisting of 100 oxen that had been sacrificed to [[Zeus]] on the first day.

The winner of an Olympic event was awarded an [[olive wreath|olive branch]] and often was received with much honour throughout Greece, especially in his home town, where he was often granted large sums of money (in Athens, 500 [[drachma]], a small fortune) and prizes including vats of [[olive oil]]. (See [[Milo of Croton]].) Sculptors would create statues of Olympic victors,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ageladas]]&lt;/ref&gt; and poets would sing odes in their praise for money.

Participation in the classical games was limited to male athletes except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the [[equestrianism|equestrian]] events. In 396&amp;nbsp;BC, and again in 392&amp;nbsp;BC, the horses of a [[Sparta]]n princess named [[Cynisca]] won the four-horse race.

The athletes usually competed [[nude]], not only as the weather was appropriate, but also as the festival was meant to celebrate, in part, the achievements of the human body. [[Olive oil#History|Olive oil]] was used by the competitors, not only as a substitute for [[soap]] for washing, bathing, and cleaning, but also as a natural [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]], to keep skin smooth, and provide an appealing look for the participants. Because the men competed nude, married women were forbidden to watch the Olympics under penalty of death.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.penn.museum/sites/olympics/olympicsexism.shtml The Women: Were the Ancient Olympic Games Just for Men?&quot;]. ''Penn Museum''.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrastingly, in [[Sparta]]—which, compared to [[Athens]], was less restrictive to its female citizens in general—both men and women did exercise unclothed.

==Olympic festivals in other places==
{{Main|Ancient Olympics in various places}}

Athletic festivals under the name of &quot;Olympic games&quot;, named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at [[Antioch]], obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''[[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'', 1875'' – [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0839.html ancientlibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Just how far back in history organized athletic contests were held remains a matter of debate, but it is reasonably certain that they occurred in [[Greece]] almost 3,000 years ago. However ancient in origin, by the end of the 6th century BCE at least four Greek sporting festivals, sometimes called &quot;classical games,&quot; had achieved major importance: the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], held at [[Olympia]]; the [[Pythian Games]] at [[Delphi]]; the [[Nemean Games]] at [[Nemea]]; and the [[Isthmian Games]], held near [[Corinth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] 2006, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games#toc59589 The ancient Olympic Games].&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Games was perhaps the greatest of all sporting event held every four years and all Olympian winners, were highly appreciated among the [[Greeks]].

== History ==
{{Main|Ancient Olympic Games}}
The sophist [[Hippias of Elis]] was the first who drew up the list of Olympians in his work ''&quot;Olympians inscription&quot;'', based perhaps on the records of Olympia, and the oral tradition memories of the older Olympiads were still live in Olympia. Conventional beginning was considered the Olympiad of 776 BC, when [[Coroebus of Elis]] win the foot race named [[Stadion (running race)|stadion]]. The work of Hippias revised and continued in the 4th century BC by [[Aristotle]], later by [[Eratosthenes]], then by [[Phlegon of Tralles]] ([[Aydın|Seleucia of Caria]]) and many others. Thus formed a kind of [[Olympians]]' chronicle, which was already in 3rd century BC the base of the ancient dating system.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;According to [[#eb1911|Encyclopaedia Britannica]] (1911), Chronology (§ Olympiads).&lt;/ref&gt; Than younger tables survives complete the list of stadion winners by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] (for the first 249 Olympiads), which included in a book by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]].&lt;ref name=euseb&gt;According to [[#euseb2|Eusebius]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ite71&gt;According to [[#ite1971|HHN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of Olympic winners in the Archaic period ==
[[File:Olympic victors on Papyrus 1185.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 222]]
The table below is an attempt to give a list (as complete as possible) of Olympic winners in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] (776 BC to 480 BC) combining all surviving sources. The work is based on records in the surviving historical and literary sources, race inscriptions, the texts of the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]], the testimony of [[Pausanias]] and the list of [[Sextus Julius Africanus]]. The first column shows the serial number of any Olympiad, the second column the same date, the third column contains the game and the fourth column lists the name and origin of the winner, or marked with [...] if the element is not readable on the papyrus and giving whenever possible a version of what could contain when an investigation exists over this element.&lt;ref name=euseb /&gt;&lt;ref name=ite71 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fhw&gt;According to [[#fhwdb|FHW]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kom39&gt;According to [[#kom1839|Müller]].&lt;/ref&gt;
